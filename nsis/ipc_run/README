Modified files from the Perl IPC::Run module, by Adam Kennedy and Barrie
    Slaymaker

For instructions about what to do with these files, see the instructions in the
    ../axmud/nsis/axmud_install.nsi file

Note that the upload to CPAN causes Kwalitee issues, so the modified files are
    removed from that version. You can get them from 

    https://github.com/axcore/axmud

Changes:
- In Run.pm, copied the &start function, renamed the copy as &start_festival,
    and made the copy call IPC::Run::Win32Helper::win32_spawn_festival, instead
    of ::win32_spawn
- Also changed the &kill_kill function to reduce the delay
- In Win32Helper.pm, copied the &win32_spawn, renamed the copy as
    &win32_spawn_festival, and adjusted the search and replace code so it
    doesn't replace every instance of " with """
