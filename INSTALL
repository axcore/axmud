AXMUD INSTALLATION
==================

To get the most recent version of Axmud, visit:

	https://axmud.sourceforge.net	
	
Axmud is known to work on MS Windows and Linux. It might be possible to install
Axmud on other systems, such as macOS and *BSD, but the authors have not been
able to confirm this yet.

1 Installation on MS Windows

The easiest way to use Axmud on Windows is to download and run the Windows
installer from the Axmud website.

The installer contains everything you need to run Axmud, including a copy of 
Strawberry Perl and all the required modules and libraries.

Users who already have Strawberry Perl and/or ActivePerl installed on their
system can install Axmud manually using any of the following methods. 

1.1 Installation using Strawberry Perl

Axmud requires the 32-bit edition of Strawberry Perl, even on a 64-bit computer.
If you have the 64-bit edition of Strawberry Perl installed on your system,
either replace it with the 32-bit edition, or use the installer described above
(which contains a copy of the portable 32-bit edition).

First, open a command prompt and get some modules from CPAN:

	cpan Archive::Extract IO::Socket::INET6 IPC::Run Net::OpenSSH Regexp::IPv6
	
Then get the following module:

	cpan File::ShareDir::Install

If the line above generates an error, try this line instead:

	cpanm --force --build-args SHELL=cmd.exe --install-args SHELL=cmd.exe File::ShareDir::Install
	
Now we need some modules from the Sisyphusion repo. 

(If you reading this document some time in the distant future and find the repo 
is no longer available, you can either search around for a replacement, or you
can use the installer.)

	ppm set repository sisyphusion http://sisyphusion.tk/ppm
	ppm set save
	ppm install Cairo Glib Pango Gtk2 Gnome2::Canvas
	
Now install Axmud. It might possible to install it directly from CPAN but, if 
not, download the source code from the Axmud website and extract the .tar.gz
file.

Open a command prompt and navigate into the extracted folder. From there,
installation is standard.

	perl Makefile.PL
	gmake
	gmake install
	axmud.pl

1.2 Installation using ActivePerl

Axmud is known to work with both 32-bit and 64-bit editions of ActivePerl.

First, open a command prompt and get some modules from CPAN:

	ppm install dmake
	ppm install Archive::Extract File::ShareDir::Install IO::Socket::INET6 IPC::Run Net::OpenSSH Regexp::IPv6
	
Now we need some modules from the Sisyphusion repo. 

(If you reading this document some time in the distant future and find the repo 
is no longer available, you can either search around for a replacement, or you
can use the installer.)

	ppm repo add http://www.sisyphusion.tk/ppm 
	ppm install Glib Gtk2 Cairo Pango Gnome2::Canvas
	
Now install Axmud. It might possible to install it directly from CPAN but, if 
not, download the source code from the Axmud website and extract the .tar.gz
file.

Open a command prompt and navigate into the extracted folder. From there,
installation is standard.

	perl Makefile.PL
	dmake
	dmake install
	axmud.pl

1.3 Creating your own MS Windows installer

The installer described above was created using a script you can find in:

	.../nsis/axmud_install.nsi

The script contains instructions for building your own installer.

2 Installation on Linux

There are four methods of installation on Linux - install using the .deb 
package, install from CPAN, install using git, or install from source.

2.1 Install using the .deb package

The quickest method, if your system supports it, is to download the .deb package
from the Axmud website.

On many modern systems, a .deb package will install itself if you double-click
on it. 

2.2 Install from CPAN

Axmud can be downloaded and installed directly from the Perl archive site, CPAN.

First, make sure you have the right dependencies. Open a terminal window and 
type:

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install build-essential libcanberra-gtk-module libgnomecanvas2-dev libwnck-dev

If you want to use sound effects and/or text-to-speech, you should also type:

	sudo apt-get install libsox-fmt-mp3 timidity
	
Then you can download and install Axmud itself:

	sudo cpan install Games::Axmud
	
When installation is complete, start Axmud by typing:

	/usr/local/bin/axmud.pl
	
2.3 Install using git

Unstable (development) versions of Axmud are available from github. 

First, make sure you have the right dependencies. Open a terminal window and 
type:

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install build-essential libcanberra-gtk-module libgnomecanvas2-dev libwnck-dev
	sudo cpan install Archive::Extract File::HomeDir File::ShareDir File::ShareDir::Install Gnome2::Canvas Gnome2::Wnck JSON Net::OpenSSH

If you want to use sound effects and/or text-to-speech, you should also type:

	sudo apt-get install libsox-fmt-mp3 timidity

Then you can download and install Axmud itself:

	git clone git://github.com/axcore/axmud
	cd axmud
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	sudo make install
	
When installation is complete, start Axmud by typing:

	axmud.pl
	
2.4 Install from source

Manual installation is quite simple. First, download the source code from the
Axmud website (the most recent file ending .tar.gz).

Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the downloaded
file, for example:

	cd Downloads
	
Then make sure you have the right dependencies:

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install build-essential libcanberra-gtk-module libgnomecanvas2-dev libwnck-dev
	sudo cpan install Archive::Extract File::HomeDir File::ShareDir File::ShareDir::Install Gnome2::Canvas Gnome2::Wnck JSON Net::OpenSSH

If you want to use sound effects and/or text-to-speech, you should also type:

	sudo apt-get install libsox-fmt-mp3 timidity

Then install Axmud itself:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	sudo make install

When installation is complete, start Axmud by typing:

	axmud.pl
