rtt / resettask               Resets a task
 
   Format:
      ;rtt <task>             Resets <task>
      ;rtt -a                 Resets all active or paused current tasks
 
   Notes:
      <task> can be any Axmud built-in or external task that's currently 
         running.
      <task> can be in the form of a task's label (e.g. 'stat, 'status'), its
         formal name (e.g. 'status_task') or the task's unique name (e.g. 
         'status_task_4').
      (Use the ';listtasklabel' command to list all task labels.)
      If there is more than one task matching <task>, they will all be reset.
 
   User commands:
      rtt / resettask
