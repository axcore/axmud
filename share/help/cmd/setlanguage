stl / setlanguage             Sets a dictionary's language
 
   Format:
      ;stl <name> <language>  Sets the language of the dictionary <name>
      ;stl <language>         Sets the current dictionary's language

   Notes:
      This command sets the name of the language used by the dictionary. It does
        not modify the contents of the dictionary itself (for that, see the help 
        for ';switchlanguage', or open an 'edit' window with the 
        ';editdictionary' command, and make the changes yourself).
      Dictionary names must be no longer than 16 characters, contain only A-Z, 
         a-z, underlines and 0-9 (not the first character) and not be one of 
         Axmud's reserved names (see the ';listreserved' command). The same
         restriction applies to the language. Non-Latin alphabets are
         acceptable.
