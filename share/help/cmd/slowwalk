slw / slowwalk                Handles the current world's slowwalk settings

   Format:
      ;slw                    Show current settings

      ;slw 0                  Turn off slowwalking
      ;slw off                Turn off slowwakling

      ;slw <num>              Set maximum of <num> world commands per second
      ;slw on                 Set maximum of 1 world command per second

      ;slw <num> <delay>      Set maximum <num> commands per <delay> seconds

   Notes:
      Slowwalking is Axmud's method of limiting the number of world commands
         that can be sent at a time. This is useful for worlds that enforce a
         limit, sometimes ignoring any commands it receives above that limit.
      Slowwalking is perhaps a misleading term, because the limit is applied to
         all world commands, not just movement commands.

      If <num> is specified, and is a positive integer, Axmud will send that
         many world commands at a time.
      <delay> can be any number, 0 or above. If 0, the system's minimum delay
         time is used. If <delay> is not specified, a delay of one second is
         set. Axmud will then wait for <delay> seconds before sending any more
         world commands.

      See also the help for ';repeat', ';intervalrepeat', ';stop' and ';crawl'.
         For Axmud's speedwalking capabilities, see the help for ';speedwalk'.
