dma / deletemacro             Deletes a macro
 
   Format:
      ;dma <switches>         Deletes a macro
 
   Notes:
      Macros are one of five types of Axmud interface (the others being 
         triggers, aliases, timers and hooks).
      Macros allow you to specify instructions to be executed automatically when
         a certain key (or combination of keys) is pressed.
      This command deletes an existing 'inactive' macro (one associated with a 
         particular profile) and its corresponding 'active' macro, if there is
         one.
      It's not possible to delete an active macro directly; enable or disable 
         the hook using ';modifymacro' to set its 'enabled' attribute instead.

      To delete the inactive macro (and the active macro based on it, if there 
         is one), one of the following (group 1) switch options must be used:
         <name>               - Deletes macro belonging to the current world
         <name> -w            - Deletes macro belonging to the current world
         <name> -g            - Deletes macro belonging to the current guild
         <name> -r            - Deletes macro belonging to the current race
         <name> -c            - Deletes macro belonging to the current char
         <name> -x <category> - Deletes macro belonging to the current custom
                                   profile <category>
         <name> -d <prof>     - Deletes macro belonging to the profile named
                                   <prof>
