load / load                   Loads a file (or files)
 
   Format:
      ;load                   Loads files for this session
      ;load <options>         Loads specific file(s) for this session
      
   Notes:
      Axmud stores its data across a number of files (use ';showfile' for a list
         of them). This command loads data from those files, overwriting any
         data stored in memory.

      If you want to load specific files, you can use <options>.
      <options> should consist of a list of switch options and/or file names. 
      The switch options used are:
         -m   Loads the world model data file, 'worldmodel'
         -t   Loads the task data file, 'tasks'
         -s   Loads the script data file, 'scripts'
         -n   Loads the contacts data file, 'contacts'
         -y   Loads the dictionary data file, 'dicts'
         -b   Loads the toolbar button data file, 'toolbar'
         -u   Loads the user command data file, 'usercmds'
         -z   Loads the zonemaps data file, 'zonemaps'
         -p   Loads the winmaps data file, 'winmaps'
         -x   Loads the text-to-speech data file, 'tts'
      File names used are: 'worldmodel', 'tasks', 'contacts', 'dicts',
         'usercmds', 'zonemaps', 'winmaps', 'tts'.

      <options> can be specified in any order:
      
         ';load -n tasks -z dicts'
         
      Each file is only loaded once, so duplicate <options> won't cause an
         error.
      The config file can't be loaded with this command; it is only ever loaded
         when the Axmud client starts.
      Profile data files can't be loaded with this command. You can load a world
         profile and all its associated data with the ';setworld' command.
