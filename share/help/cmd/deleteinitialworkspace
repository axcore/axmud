diw / deleteinitialworkspace  Deletes an initial workspace
 
   Format:
      ;diw <num>              Deletes the initial workspace <num>

   Notes:
      Axmud supports multiple desktops or 'workspaces'. Workspaces can be both
         real and virtual. If you have multiple physical monitors, each one is a
         workspace. If your computer has a workspace switcher, allowing you to 
         switch between virtual desktops, each one is a workspace.
      This command removes a workspace from the list of workspaces Axmud uses
         when it starts. The workspace in which Axmud starts is its 'default
         workspace', which cannot be removed. 
      Use the ';listinitialworkspace' command to get a list of initial 
         workspace numbers.
      See also the help for ';addinitialworkspace'.

   User commands:
      diw / deliw / deleteinitialworkspace
