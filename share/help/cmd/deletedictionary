ddy / deletedictionary        Deletes a dictionary
 
   Format:
      ;ddy <name>             Deletes the dictionary <name>
 
   Notes:
      Dictionaries help Axmud to interpret the text it receives from the world.
      An Axmud dictionary stores groups of words. It contains a group of weapon
         words ('sword', 'mace', etc), a group of words for living beings
         ('orc', 'dwarf', etc), and several more besides.
      It also contains several useful terms, such as phrases for times of the
         day.

      This command deletes a dictionary, but it can't be used if any existing
         session is using that dictionary as its current dictionary.
