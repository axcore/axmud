dms / deleteminionstring      Deletes minion string(s) from the world model
 
   Format:
      ;dms <pattern>          Deletes minion strings matching <pattern>
 
   Notes:
      The world model stores information about the regions, rooms, characters
         and objects in the game world. The automapper window uses the model to
         display its maps.
      The world model can also keep track of minions - non-player characters 
         which are controlled directly by players.

      Minion objects are treated a little differently to other model objects.
         The world model stores a collection of strings which the world uses to
         describe a minion. The world might use more than one string for the
         same minion and some strings are independent of any specific minion
         (see the help for ';addminionstring' for more information).
      This command deletes any minion strings which match the regular expression
         <pattern>. No minion objects are removed from the model.
      If <pattern> contains spaces, it must be enclosed within diamond brackets
         <...>. Minion strings are case-insensitive.
