ads / addsecondary            Adds a secondary direction
 
   Format:
      ;ads <custom>
      ;ads <custom> <abbrev>  Adds the direction

   Notes:
      Axmud provides eighteen 'standard' primary directions - the sixteen
         compass directions (including 'north', 'northeast' and
         'northnortheast') as well as 'up' and 'down'. This standard set never
         changes.
      Axmud dictionaries store a custom set of primary directions, one for each
         standard direction. Dictionaries also store a set of secondary
         directions such as 'out' and 'in', this set can contain as many or as
         few directions as you want.
      For a list of primary and secondary directions stored in the current
         dictionary, use the 'listdirection' command.         

      This command adds a new secondary direction.
      <custom> must not already exist in the current dictionary as a custom
         primary or secondary direction.
      <abbrev> is an abbreviated form of the secondary direction. If you don't
         specify <abbrev>, no abbreviation is stored. (Most worlds don't use
         abbreviated forms of directions like 'out', 'in' and so on.)

      Here's an example:

         ;ads leave l

      If you add a pair of secondary directions, you can specify that the should
         be treated as opposites using the ';modifysecondary' command.

      Continuing the example:

         ;ads leave l
         ;ads enter en
         ;mds leave enter
         ;mds enter leave
 
   User commands:
      ads / addsecond / addsecondary
