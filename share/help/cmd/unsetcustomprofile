ucp / unsetcustomprofile      Unsets a current custom profile

   Format:
      ;ucp <profile>          Unsets a current custom profile

   Notes:
      Besides having a guild profile and a race profile, characters can have any
         number of custom profiles marked as a current profile.
      After using this command, the custom <profile> will no longer be current.
         All interfaces used by the profile will become unavailable. (They will
         be restored the next time this profile is made current.)
      You can select the next current custom profile with the
         ';setcustomprofile' command.

   User commands:
      ucp / unsetcustom / unsetcustomprof / unsetcustomprofile
