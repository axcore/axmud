scw / setcustomweek           Sets customised days of the week
 
   Format:
      ;scw                    Shows current list of customised days
      ;scw <days>             Sets a new list
      ;scw -r                 Resets the list
      
   Notes:  
      Axmud doesn't offer a generalised locale setting (converting everything 
         into your preferred language), but you can at least change the days of
         of week used in logfiles with this command.
      If you specify <days>, you must specify exactly seven words containing
         A-Z, a-z, 0-9 or underlines (first character must be a letter; maximum
         16 characters for each word). Non-Latin alphabets are acceptable.
      Also see the help for ';setcustommonth'.
