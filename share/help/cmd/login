lgn / login                   Marks the current character as logged in

   Format:
      ;lgn                    Marks the character as logged in

   Notes:
      When Axmud spots that the character has logged in, several things can
         happen, and in the following order:
         - Some of Axmud's stored data is updated
         - Commands like 'term ansi', 'cols 80', 'rows 50' are sent to the
              world, if the current world profile permits it
         - Any initial tasks are started. The global initial tasklist is checked
              first, followed by each current profile's initial tasklist
         - Any initial scripts are started. The global initial scriptlist is
              checked first, followed by each current profile's initial
              scriptlist
         - The first initial mission assigned to a profile is started; initial
              missions assigned to other profiles are ignored
         - Initial world commands (e.g. 'look', 'score') stored in each profile
              are sent, but duplicate commands are ignored
         - Any tasks now in the current tasklist which are waiting for a login
              can now initialise themselves
      Profiles are always checked in the usual priority order; so, for example,
         an initial mission assigned to the current world profile (which always
         has the lowest priority) will only run if there are no missions
         assigned to any other current profile.
      Axmud is able to log in to the world automatically - if the current world
         profile has been set up to allow it - but if not, you can use this
         command to override the automatic login process (if any) and mark the
         character as logged in.
