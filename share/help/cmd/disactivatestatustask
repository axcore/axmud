dst / disactivatestatustask   Disactivates the Status task

   Format:
      ;dst                    Disactivates the Status task

   Notes:
      In 'active' mode, the Status task sends commands to the world every few
         seconds (usually commands like 'score', 'sc' and 'time') to keep the
         task's statistics up to date.
      In 'disactived' mode, those commands are suspended, and won't be sent to
         the world until the task is activated again.
      The commands sent are taken from the current character profile (which in
         turn inherits them from the current world profile).
      Use ';activatestatustask' to activate the Status task.

   User commands:
      dst / disactivatestatustask
