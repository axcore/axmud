luc / listusercommand         Lists user commands

   Format:
      ;luc                    Lists current user commands
      ;luc -d                 Lists the default set of user commands

   Notes:
      All client commands have a single standard form (for example, this
         command's standard form is 'addusercommand').
      Some of the standard forms for client commands are quite long, so Axmud
          allows the user to create abbreviated versions called 'user commands'.
      This command lists all user commands, including built-in user commands and
         any user commands you created yourself by using ';addusercommand'.
      (See the help for ';addusercommand' for more information about user
         commmands.)

   User commands:
      luc / listuc / listusercmd / listusercommand
