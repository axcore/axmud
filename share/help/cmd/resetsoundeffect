rse / resetsoundeffect        Resets sound effects to defaults

   Format:
      ;rse                    Resets all sound effects

   Notes:
      Axmud's sound effects bank contains a list of named sound effects, each of
         which corresponds to a sound file. This command resets the sound
         effects bank to its default state, but it doesn't modify any of the
         files in Axmud's '/sounds' directory.
      See the help for ';sound' for more information about the default sound
         effects bank.

   User commands:
      rse / resetse / resetsound / resetsoundeffect
