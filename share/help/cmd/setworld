swo / setworld                Sets the current world profile

   Format:
      ;swo <world>            Sets the current world profile to <world>
      ;swo <world> <char>     Sets the current world and character profiles

   Notes:
      This command sets current profiles for this session.
      If a world profile named <world> doesn't already exist, it is created. If
         a dictionary with the same name as the world doesn't already exist, it
         too is created.
      If a world profile named <world> already exists, the world profile and all
         its associated profiles, profile templates and cages are loaded from
         files.
      If <char> is not specified, the session won't have a current character
         profile (and by extension, a current guild or race profile). One should
         be set as soon as possible with the ';setchar' command.
      If <char> is specified but the profile doesn't yet exist, it is created.

      Profile names must be no longer than 16 characters, contain only A-Z, a-z,
         underlines and 0-9 (not the first character) and not be one of Axmud's
         reserved names (see the ';listreserved' command). Non-Latin alphabets
         are acceptable.
      The operation will fail if <world> or <char> are specified, but invalid.

   User commands:
