cko / clonekeycodeobject      Clones a keycode object
 
   Format:
      ;cko <original> <copy>
               Clones keycode object <original> into one named <copy>
 
   Notes:
      Keycodes are used by the system to recognise the keys on your keyboard.
         For example, the F5 key usually has the keycode 'F5', and the two SHIFT 
         keys often have the keycodes 'Shift_L' and 'Shift_R'.
      Keycodes vary between systems, so Axmud offers a set of standard keycodes
         (for example 'f5' and 'shift'). Axmud represents two keys pressed down
         together as a keycode string like 'shift f5' or 'ctrl c'. 
      Axmud's standard keycodes are mostly used with macros; they allow you to 
         design macros that will work on all systems, not just the one you're 
         using right now.

      Keycodes (and keycode strings) are stored in a keycode object. You might
         have one called 'linux' and another one called 'windows', one of which
         would be set as the 'current' keycode object. 
      This command clones an existing keycode object, producing a new one
         containing the same set of keycodes.
      Keycode object names must be no longer than 16 characters, contain only 
         A-Z, a-z, underlines and 0-9 (not the first character) and not be one 
         of Axmud's reserved names (see the ';listreserved' command). Non-Latin
         alphabets are acceptable.
