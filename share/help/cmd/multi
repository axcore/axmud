multi / multi                 Interprets a multi string in multiple sessions
 
   Format:
      ;multi <string>         Interprets the <string>
      
   Notes:
      Multi commands can be typed in the 'main' window's command entry box. 
         These commands start with the multi sigil, a colon character:
      
         :kill orc
                  
      Everything after the sigil is interpreted as a world command in multiple
         sessions: either in all sessions connected to the same world as this
         session, or in every single session (use ';toggleinstruction -m' to 
         switch between these two settings).
         
      Multi sigils are turned off by default (use ';togglesigil -m' to turn them
         on again). However, this client command is always available, and you
         don't need to type the sigil:
         
         ;multi kill orc
         
      If you want to preserve spacing between words, you can enclose the whole
         <string> in diamond brackets <...>:
         
         ;multi <say Hello...      I'm back!>
          
   User commands:
      multi
