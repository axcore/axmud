cr / clonerace                Clones a race profile

   Format:
      ;cr <original> <copy>
               Clones the race profile <original> into one named <copy>

   Notes:
      This operation clones the race and all its associated cages, including all
         the interfaces stored in the cages.
      Profile names must be no longer than 16 characters, contain only A-Z, a-z,
         underlines and 0-9 (not the first character) and not be one of Axmud's
         reserved names (see the ';listreserved' command). Non-Latin alphabets
         are acceptable.
      The operation will fail if a profile called <copy> already exists or if
         <copy> is an invalid name.

   User commands:
      cr / copyrace / clonerace
