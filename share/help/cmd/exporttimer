xti / exporttimer             Exports a timer to the interface clipboard

   Format:
      ;xti <switches>         Exports a timer

   Notes:
      Timers are one of five types of Axmud interface (the others being
         triggers, aliases, macros and hooks).
      Timers allow you to execute an instruction repeatedly at fixed intervals,
         and also to specify an instruction to be executed later.
      This command provides a simple way to copy timers from one profile/cage
         to another (perhaps even in a different world, in a different session).
         It 'exports' the timer to Axmud's interface clipboard, from where it
         can be 'imported'.
      Note that the contents of the clipboard are not saved, when Axmud saves
         its files. Note also that the timer's attributes might change while
         stored in the clipboard. In other words, it's up to you to perform the
         export, then the import, before doing anything else.
      You can repeat this command as often as you like, to add multiple timers
         to the clipboard, before importing them all together with
         ';importtimer'. Use ';emptyclipboard' when you want to start afresh.
         Note that 'Export' buttons in preference/edit windows empty the
         clipboard, before adding one or interfaces to it.
      Both active and inactive timers can be exported.

      <switches> allows you to define which timer (and which of its attributes)
         should be exported.

      To export an active timer directly, one of the following (group 0) switch
         options must be used:
         -i <name>            - Exports the active timer <name>
         -i <number>          - Exports the active timer <number>
      However, to export an inactive timer, one of the following (group 1)
         switch options must be used instead:
         <name>               - Exports timer belonging to the current world
         <name> -w            - Exports timer belonging to the current world
         <name> -r            - Exports timer belonging to the current race
         <name> -g            - Exports timer belonging to the current guild
         <name> -c            - Exports timer belonging to the current char
         <name> -x <category> - Exports timer belonging to the current custom
                                   profile <category>
         <name> -d <prof>     - Exports timer belonging to the profile named
                                   <prof>
