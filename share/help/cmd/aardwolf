aard / aardwolf               Handles AARD102 (Aardwolf 102 channel) data

   Format:
      ;aard                   Show current AARD102 status

      ;aard <option>          Turn tags on
      ;aard <option> <flag>   Turn tags on/off, depending on <flag>

   Notes:
      The world can use the AARD102 protocol to send extra information about the
         game state. Very few worlds use it, indeed it has been officially
         described as 'deprecated'; nevertheless Axmud supports it.

      When using AARD102, the world frequently sends status messages to the
         client. Use this command without <option> or <flag> to see the most
         recent status message received, and the time at which the MUD last
         'ticked'.
      The status is received as a number. Axmud converts into a string:

         1 'at_login_screen'   - At login screen, no player yet
         2 'at_motd'           - Player at MOTD or other login sequence
         3 'player_active'     - Player fully active and able to receive MUD
                                    commands
         4 'player_afk'        - Player AFK
         5 'note_mode'         - Player in note mode
         6 'edit_mode'         - Player in Building/Edit mode
         7 'page_prompt'       - Player at paged output prompt
         8 'player_rest'       - (proposed - possibly never implemented)
         9 'code_nine'         - (used by Aardwolf, but the meaning is unknown)

         n 'unknown_n', where n is any other value (range 1-254)
                               - any other value not described by AARD102's
                                    authors

      In addition, the user can use this command to turn on various kinds of
         tags. For example, you can ask the MUD to surround the whole inventory
         list within the tags

         {inventory}...{/inventory}

      Because AARD102 is deprecated, Axmud has not implemented any kind of
         handling for these tags. If you really want to make use of them, you
         would have to create some triggers to intercept lines containing those
         tags, and to redirect the lines to your own plugin code.

      If specified, <option> is a number in the range 1-254. The AARD102 authors
         have documented the following values:

         1   Statmon
         2   Bigmap + Coordinates tags
         3   Help tags
         4   Map tags
         5   Channel tags
         6   Tell tags (see ‘help telltags’ in game)
         7   Spellup tags (see ‘help spelltags’ in game)
         8   Skillgains tags
         9   Say tags
         11  Score tags
         12  Room names in mapper
         14  Exits in mapper
         15  Editor tags
         16  Equip tags
         17  Inventory tags

         50  Quiet all tags (tags quiet on/off)
         51  Turn autotick on/off
         52  Turn prompts on/off
         53  Turn output paging on/off (remembers pagesize)

      <flag> can be 1, 0 or any word beginning with either 't' (for 'true') or
         'f' (for 'false'). <flag> can also be the words 'on' or 'off'.
