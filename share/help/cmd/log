log / log                     Toggles logfile settings on/off

   Format:
      ;log                    Shows current logfile settings
      ;log <switch>           Toggles a setting on or off
      ;log <logfile>          Starts/stops writing to a particular <logfile>

   Notes:
      Axmud writes logs to a number of different logfiles simultaneously. You
         can enable/disable writing to all logfiles at once, or you can enable/
         disable writing to individual logfiles, one at a time.

      If <switch> is specified, it can be any of the following:
         -l   Enables/disables all logging without affecting any other logfile
                 preferences (disabled by default)
         -d   Toggles deletion of standard logfiles - those not associated with
                 a particular world - when the client starts (off by default)
         -w   Toggles deletion of world logfiles - those associated with the
                 current world - when the session starts (off by default)
         -y   Toggles creation of new logfiles at the beginning of every day;
                 otherwise new text is appended to existing files (on by
                 default)
         -s   Toggles creation of new logfiles when the client starts; otherwise
                 new text is appended to existing files (on by default)
         -a   Toggles prefixing every line in logfiles with the current date (on
                 by default)
         -t   Toggles prefixing every line in logfiles with the current time (on
                 by default)
         -i   Toggles display of image filenames in logfiles

      If <logfile> is specified, it toggles writing to that particular logfile.
