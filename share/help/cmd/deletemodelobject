dmo / deletemodelobject       Deletes an object from the world model

   Format:
      ;dmo <number>           Deletes the object <number>

   Notes:
      The world model stores information about the regions, rooms, characters
         and objects in the game world. The automapper window uses the
         information stored in the world model to draw its maps.
      This command deletes the object along with any child objects. It cannot
         be used to delete regions, rooms or exits - use ';deleteregion',
         ';deleteroom' or ';deleteexit' instead.

   User commands:
      dmo / delmo / delmodel / deletemodelobject
