ddp / deletedivertpattern     Deletes a pattern for Divert tasks

   Format:
      ;dsp <type> <number>
               Deletes the pattern <number> of <type>
 
   Notes:
      The Divert task intercepts text received from the world and displays it in
         its own task window. 
      The patterns used are stored in the current world profile. This command
         deletes one of those patterns. (See the help for ';adddivertpattern' 
         for more information about Divert task patterns.)
 
      <type> defines what kind of pattern is to be deleted:
         -t   'tell' patterns
         -e   An exception to a 'tell' pattern
 
         -s   Social patterns
         -o   An exception to a social pattern
 
         -c   Custom patterns 
         -u   Custom patterns
         -x   An exception to a custom pattern
      The switches -c and -u work on both gagged and ungagged custom patterns.
 
      <number> is the pattern's number in the list produced by the 
         ';listdivertpattern' command. (NB When a pattern is deleted, the other 
         patterns in the same list will be re-numbered.)
