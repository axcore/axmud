mcs / modifycolourscheme      Modifies a colour scheme
 
   Format:
      ;mcs <name> <switches>  Modifies the colour scheme <name>
 
   Notes:
      A textview is a scrolling area of a window where text is displayed. A
         colour scheme determines the colours and font used in the textview.
      Axmud provides a standard set of colour schemes, one for each window type.
         These colour schemes can be modified with this command, but not 
         deleted.
  
      <switches> consists of one or more switch options, in any order:

         -t <text>        - Sets the text colour, must be an Axmud colour tag
         -t               - Resets the text colour

         -u <underlay>    - Sets the underlay colour, must be an Axmud underlay
                               colour tag
         -u               - Resets the underlay colour

         -b <background>  - Sets the background colour, must be an Axmud colour
                               tag
         -b               - Resets the background colour

         -f <font>        - Sets the font
         -f               - Resets the font

         -s <size>        - Sets the font size, must be a positive integer
         -s               - Resets the font size

      Windows using the modified colour scheme are not updated automatically.
         You can use the ';updatecolourscheme' command to update window panes in
         'internal' windows, but in all other situations the modified colour
         scheme is not used until a window is created or re-drawn.
      See also the help for ';applycolourscheme'.
