mcs / modifycolourscheme      Modifies a colour scheme

   Format:
      ;mcs <name> <switches>  Modifies the colour scheme <name>

   Notes:
      A textview is a scrolling area of a window where text is displayed. A
         colour scheme determines the colours and font used in the textview.
      Axmud provides a standard set of colour schemes, one for each window type.
         These colour schemes can be modified with this command, but not
         deleted.

      <switches> consists of one or more switch options, in any order:

         -t <text>        - Sets the text colour, must be an Axmud colour tag
         -t               - Resets the text colour

         -u <underlay>    - Sets the underlay colour, must be an Axmud underlay
                               colour tag
         -u               - Resets the underlay colour

         -b <background>  - Sets the background colour, must be an Axmud colour
                               tag
         -b               - Resets the background colour

         -f <font>        - Sets the font
         -f               - Resets the font

         -s <size>        - Sets the font size, must be a positive integer
         -s               - Resets the font size

         -m               - Toggles the setting to ignore all colours besides
                               the text and background colours

         -a <old> <new>   - Adds a colour override, with any text using the
                               colour tag <old> displayed using the colour tag
                               <new> instead
         -a <old>         - Adds a colour override, with any text using the
                               colour tag <old> displayed in the usual colour
                               instead
         -d <old>         - Deletes a colour override

         -n               - Turns off text wrapping
         -c               - Ignores words when wrapping text
         -w               - Preserves words when wrapping text
         -e               - Preserves words when wrapping text (if possible;
                               this is the default setting)

      If you specify more than one of the text wrapping switches, only the first
          one is used; the rest are ignored. Note that, in most cases, the world
          knows how big Axmud's 'main' window is, and formats text before
          sending it, so changing the setting for the 'main' colour scheme may
          not have any effect.

      Windows using the modified colour scheme are not updated automatically.
         You can use the ';updatecolourscheme' command to update window panes in
         'internal' windows, but in all other situations the modified colour
         scheme is not used until a window is created or re-drawn.
      See also the help for ';applycolourscheme'.
