aw / addworld                 Adds a world profile
 
   Format:
      ;aw <name>              Adds the world profile <name>
 
   Notes:
      Profile names must be no longer than 16 characters, contain only A-Z, a-z, 
         underlines and 0-9 (not the first character) and not be one of Axmud's 
         reserved names (see the ';listreserved' command).
      The operation will fail if a world profile called <name> already exists or
         if <name> is invalid.
      To create a world profile and set it as the current world profile, use the
         ';setworld' command.
      This command automatically creates a dictionary with the same name as the 
          world, if one does not exist already.
