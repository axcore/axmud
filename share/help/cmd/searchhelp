sh / searchhelp               Searches Axmud help
 
   Format:
      ;sh <terms>             Search client commands and descriptions only
      ;sh -c <terms>          Search client command help files
      ;sh -b <terms>          Search Axbasic help files
      ;sh -t <terms>          Search task help files
 
   Notes:
      The commands ';help', ';axbasichelp' and ';taskhelp' show help on hundreds
         of different topics. Axmud stores help for each topic in a separate 
         file; this command searches the help files, looking for those which
         mention the search terms you specify.

      <terms> can be one or more words:
      
         ;searchhelp script
         ;searchhelp chat email
         
      If two or more search terms are specified, this command looks for help 
         files which matches any of them.
      Each word is treated as a regular expression (regex), so you can use 
         special characters like this:
         
         ;searchhelp scr.*
         ;searchhelp tr+ll
         
      If you want to search for a phrase such as 'chat email', you can use 
         diamond brackets to force Axmud to treat 'chat email' as a single 
         search term (this is the equivalent of using "..." in search engines 
         like Google):
         
         ;searchhelp <chat email> 
         
      You can also use diamond brackets in regular expressions which use spaces:
      
         ;searchhelp <you can .* an interface>
      
      If you specify the switch -c, the whole help file for the client command 
         is searched; otherwise only the commands' descriptions are searched. 
         (The descriptions are what you see when you use ';help' without 
         specifying any topics.)
      The switch -b searches the help files for both Axbasic keywords and
         intrinsic (built-in) functions.
      Search terms are case-insensitive, so these commands are interchangeable:
      
         ;searchhelp hobbit
         ;searchhelp HoBBiT
         
      Depending on the speed of your computer, the search may take a few 
         seconds.

   User commands:
