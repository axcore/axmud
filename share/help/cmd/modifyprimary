mpr / modifyprimary           Modifies a primary direction
 
   Format:
      ;mpr <standard> <custom>
      ;mpr <standard> <custom> <abbrev>
                              Modifies the direction

   Notes:
      Axmud provides eighteen 'standard' primary directions - the sixteen
         compass directions (including 'north', 'northeast' and
         'northnortheast') as well as 'up' and 'down'. This standard set never
         changes.
      Axmud dictionaries store a custom set of primary directions, one for each
         standard direction. Dictionaries also store a set of secondary
         directions such as 'out' and 'in', this set can contain as many or as
         few directions as you want.
      For a list of primary and secondary directions stored in the current
         dictionary, use the 'listdirection' command.               

      If you want to modify the current dictionary's custom primary directions
         (often because you're playing a world whose language is not English),
         you can use this command.
      <standard> is one of the standard primary directions described above.
      <custom> is a customised primary direction.
      <abbrev> is an abbreviated form of the customised direction. If you don't
         specify <abbrev>, no abbreviation is stored.

      As an example, you could start modifying the current direction to use
         directions in French like this:

            ;mpr north nord n
            ;mpr west ouest o

      However, for some languages (French among them), all directions can be
         updated at once using the button in the dictionary's edit window.
