dhk / deletehook              Deletes a hook

   Format:
      ;dhk <switches>         Deletes a hook

   Notes:
      Hooks are one of five types of Axmud interface (the others being triggers,
         aliases, macros and timers).
      Hooks allow you to specify instructions to be executed automatically when
         certain events happen.
      This command deletes an existing 'inactive' hook (one associated with a
         particular profile) and its corresponding 'active' hook, if there is
         one.
      It's not possible to delete an active hook directly; enable or disable the
         hook using ';modifyhook' to set its 'enabled' attribute instead.

      To delete the inactive hook (and the active hook based on it, if there
         is one), one of the following (group 1) switch options must be used:
         <name>               - Deletes hook belonging to the current world
         <name> -w            - Deletes hook belonging to the current world
         <name> -g            - Deletes hook belonging to the current guild
         <name> -r            - Deletes hook belonging to the current race
         <name> -c            - Deletes hook belonging to the current char
         <name> -x <category> - Deletes hook belonging to the current custom
                                   profile <category>
         <name> -d <prof>     - Deletes hook belonging to the profile named
                                   <prof>
