mtr / modifytrigger           Modifies a trigger
 
   Format:
      ;mtr <switches>         Modifies a trigger
 
   Notes:
      Triggers are one of five types of Axmud interface (the others being
         aliases, macros, timers and hooks).
      Triggers allow you to react automatically to text received from the world.
         The reaction can have one of three forms: the trigger can execute an 
         instruction (including world commands, forced world commands, client 
         commands, echo commands, Perl commands, script commands and multi
         commands) or it can split a line into two (a 'splitter' trigger), or it 
         can change the way the received text is displayed in the 'main' window 
         (a 'rewriter' trigger), 
      This command modifies the attributes of an existing 'inactive' trigger 
         (one associated with a particular profile) and its corresponding 
         'active' trigger, if there is one.
      It's also possibly to modify the active trigger directly, in which case, 
         the changes won't apply to the parent inactive trigger (and will only 
         last for the session, or until the active trigger is deleted).

      <switches> allows you to define which trigger (and which of its 
         attributes) should be modified.

      To modify the active trigger directly, one of the following (group 0) 
         switch options must be used:
         -i <name>            - Modifies the active trigger <name>
         -i <number>          - Modifies the active trigger <number>
      However, to modify the inactive trigger (and the active trigger based on 
         it, if there is one), one of the following (group 1) switch options  
         must be used instead:
         <name>               - Modifies trigger belonging to the current world
         <name> -w            - Modifies trigger belonging to the current world
         <name> -r            - Modifies trigger belonging to the current race
         <name> -g            - Modifies trigger belonging to the current guild
         <name> -c            - Modifies trigger belonging to the current char
         <name> -x <category> - Modifies trigger belonging to the current custom
                                   profile <category>
         <name> -d <prof>     - Modifies trigger belonging to the profile named
                                   <prof>

      One or more of the following group 2/3 switch options must be used.
      Group 2 switch options: 
         -s <pattern>         - Modifies the 'stimulus' attribute (a regex)
         -p <instruction> / -p <substitution>  
                              - Modifies the 'response' attribute (an 
                                   instruction, or a substitution for 'rewriter'
                                   triggers)
      Group 3 switch options:

      Group 4 switch options (only modify the inactive trigger, so can't be 
         used with the -i switch):
         -b <name>            - This trigger is checked before triggers called
                                   <name> (when they both become active)
         -y <name>            - This trigger is not checked before triggers 
                                   called <name> (when they both become active)
         -f <name>            - This trigger is checked after triggers called
                                   <name> (when they both become active)
         -z <name>            - This trigger is not checked after triggers 
                                   called <name> (when they both become active)

   General interface notes:
      If <instruction>, <pattern>, <string> or <substitution> contain 
         whitespace, they must be enclosed by diamond brackets
         
            e.g. <You see (.*) exits>
            
      <boolean> can be typed as 1 or 0, or any word beginning with t, T, f or F
