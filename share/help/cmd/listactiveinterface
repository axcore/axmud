lai / listactiveinterface     Lists active interfaces

   Format:
      ;lai                    Lists interfaces (in order of checking)
      ;lai -o                 Lists interfaces (in order of checking)
      ;lai -a                 Lists interfaces (alphabetically)
      ;lai -n                 Lists interfaces (in ascending order numerically)
      ;lai -d                 Lists dependent interfaces
      ;lai -i                 Lists indepedent interfaces
      ;lai -v                 Verbose list of interfaces (alphabetically)
      ;lai -c <category>      List interfaces of <category>

   Notes:
      Axmud interfaces are triggers, aliases, macros, timers and hooks.
      Most interfaces are associated with a particular profile and are called
         'inactive' interfaces. When the profile becomes a current profile, its
         interfaces become 'active' (except those whose name is the same as an
         existing active interface associated with a higher-priority profile).
         This command lists active interfaces.
      'Dependent' interfaces cause some task or script to be executed, whereas
         'independent' interfaces don't.
      Switches can be combined, e.g. ';lai -d -i' has the same effect as ';lai'.
         However, the switches -o, -a and -n can't be combined.
      <category> can be 'trigger', 'alias', 'macro', 'timer' or 'hook'.
