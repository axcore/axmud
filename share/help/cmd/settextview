stv / settextview             Sets the default size of textviews
 
   Format:
      ;stv <size>             Sets the default <size>
      ;stv                    Resets the default size to 10000
 
   Notes:
      A textview is a scrolling area of a window where text is displayed. A
         textview object is an Axmud component which handles these areas
         intelligently.
      This command sets a default <size> for textviews. <size>, if specified, 
         must be an integer in the range 10-1000000.
      
      The Axmud code can create textviews with no size limit; the default size
         does not apply to these textviews.

   User commands:
