qaw / quickaddword            Opens a window to add words to the dictionary

   Format:
      ;qaw                    Adds words or terms

   Notes:
      Dictionaries help Axmud to interpret the text it receives from the world.
      An Axmud dictionary stores groups of words. It contains a group of weapon
         words ('sword', 'mace', etc), a group of words for living beings
         ('orc', 'dwarf', etc), and several more besides.
      It also contains several useful terms, such as phrases for times of the
         day.

      This command opens a window from which you can add new words and terms to
         the current dictionary.
      If the ';collectunknownwords' command has been used to turn word
         collection on, those words are also listed in the window.
      See also the help for ';addword'.
