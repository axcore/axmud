dls / deletelabelstyle        Deletes a map label style
 
   Format:
      ;dls <name>             Deletes the style
 
   Notes:
      Map labels are drawn in the automapper window. It's possible to customise
         labels individually, but most labels are drawn using a map label style
         (so that when the style is changed, all labels using that style are
         redrawn automatically).
      <name> is the name of the style to delete. If it contains spaces, you
         should enclose the name in diamond brackets <...>.
      Any labels using the deleted style become customised labels, with their
         attributes set to default values.
 
   User commands:
      dls / delstyle / deletestyle / deletelabelstyle
