atcp / atcp                   Shows ATCP data reported by the current world
 
   Format:
      ;atcp                   Shows all ATCP packages
      ;atcp <name>            Shows the package called or starting with <name>
 
   Notes:
      The world can use the ATCP protocol to send extra information about the 
         game state. This information is normally invisible to the user when it
         is received by Axmud, but it is available for use with your tasks and 
         scripts, and can also be viewed using this command.
      An ATCP package contains one or more pieces of data. Typical package 
         <name>s include 'char.stats', 'char.items.inv' and 'room.info'. Names
         are case-insensitive.
      If you don't specify a <name>, all ATCP packages are shown. 
      If a package called <name> doesn't exist, a list of ATCP packages that 
         start with the <name> (if any) are shown. For example, you can use the
         <name> 'char' to show the packages 'char.stats' and 'char.items.inv'.

      Some ATCP packages are not sent to the client unless the client requests
         it in some way. For details about which ATCP packages you can request
         (if any), consult the world's own documentation and then use the Axmud 
         client command ';sendatcp'.
      The GMCP protocol is very similar (see the help for ';gmcp').
