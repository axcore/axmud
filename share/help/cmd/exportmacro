xma / exportmacro             Exports a macro to the interface clipboard

   Format:
      ;xma <switches>         Exports a macro

   Notes:
      Macros are one of five types of Axmud interface (the others being
         triggers, aliases, timers and hooks).
      Macros allow you to specify instructions to be executed automatically when
         a certain key (or combination of keys) is pressed.
      This command provides a simple way to copy macros from one profile/cage
         to another (perhaps even in a different world, in a different session).
         It 'exports' the macro to Axmud's interface clipboard, from where it
         can be 'imported'.
      Note that the contents of the clipboard are not saved, when Axmud saves
         its files. Note also that the macro's attributes might change while
         stored in the clipboard. In other words, it's up to you to perform the
         export, then the import, before doing anything else.
      You can repeat this command as often as you like, to add multiple macros
         to the clipboard, before importing them all together with
         ';importmacro'. Use ';emptyclipboard' when you want to start afresh.
         Note that 'Export' buttons in preference/edit windows empty the
         clipboard, before adding one or interfaces to it.
      Both active and inactive macros can be exported.

      <switches> allows you to define which macro (and which of its attributes)
         should be exported.

      To export an active macro directly, one of the following (group 0) switch
         options must be used:
         -i <name>            - Exports the active macro <name>
         -i <number>          - Exports the active macro <number>
      However, to export an inactive macro, one of the following (group 1)
         switch options must be used instead:
         <name>               - Exports macro belonging to the current world
         <name> -w            - Exports macro belonging to the current world
         <name> -r            - Exports macro belonging to the current race
         <name> -g            - Exports macro belonging to the current guild
         <name> -c            - Exports macro belonging to the current char
         <name> -x <category> - Exports macro belonging to the current custom
                                   profile <category>
         <name> -d <prof>     - Exports macro belonging to the profile named
                                   <prof>
