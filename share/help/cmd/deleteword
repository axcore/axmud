dlw / deleteword              Deletes words or terms from the current dictionary
 
   Format:
      ;dlw <switches>         Deletes words or terms
 
   Notes:
      Dictionaries help Axmud to interpret the text it receives from the world.
      An Axmud dictionary stores groups of words. It contains a group of weapon
         words ('sword', 'mace', etc), a group of words for living beings
         ('orc', 'dwarf', etc), and several more besides.
      It also contains several useful terms, such as phrases for times of the
         day.

      This command deletes words and terms from the current dictionary.

         brackets <...>
      Switch options can be combined in a single command:
      
         e.g. ';deleteword -r orc -r troll -w sword -k butterfly'
         
      Standard time words (added with ';addword -t <...>') cannot be deleted.
