ale / alternativeexit         Sets an exit's alternative direction(s)

   Format:
      ;ale <dir> <string>     Sets the exit <dir>'s alt direction <string>

   Notes:
      A few worlds, most notably Discworld, present a room with an exit list
         that depends on the direction from which the character entered the
         room (for example, a room there might have an exit that's sometimes
         called 'forward', and sometimes called 'backward').

      This command works on the automapper's current room.
      <dir> should be the direction of an exit in that room, for example
         'forward'.
      <string> is any string containing alternative forms of the exit, for
         example 'backword', or 'forward backward side to side'.
      Once the alternative direction <string> is set, the automapper should be
         able to recognise any exit whose direction can be found in the string
         (in the example above, 'forward', 'back', 'backward', 'side',
         'side to side' and 'backward side' would all be recognised).
