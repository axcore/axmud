ars / addregionscheme         Adds a region colour scheme
 
   Format:
      ;ars <name>             Adds a scheme called <name>
 
   Notes:
      A region colour scheme defines a set of colours for one or more regions.
         The automapper window uses these colours when it draws the region(s).
      There is always one region colour scheme, called 'default', which is used
         to draw any regions that hasn't been allocated a custom region colour
         scheme. The default region colour scheme can't be deleted.
       <name> can contain any text (maximum 16 characters). If it contains
         spaces, you should enclose the name in diamond brackets <...>.
