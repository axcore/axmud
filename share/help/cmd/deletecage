dcg / deletecage              Removes all instances of an obsolete cage type
 
   Format:
      ;dcg <type>             Removes all instances of cage <type>
      ;dcg                    Removes all instances of obsolete cage types

   Notes:
      Axmud can load plugins which add new types of cage. If the plugin fails to
         load for some reason, cages of that type are not destroyed; however, if 
         you no longer want to use cages of a particular type, you can use this 
         command to remove them.
      This command removes cages of the specified type(s) from every open
         session. If you don't specify a <type>, all cages whose type isn't
         recognised are removed.
      In order to eradicate all traces of a particular cage type, you might
         want to open every world in 'offline' mode before using this command
         and saving all files.

   User commands:
