      ;ldn -l                 Moves down a layer and shows a longer confirmation
 
   Notes:
      The workspace grid is an invisible grid, spanning the whole available
         workspace, on which Axmud tries to arrange its windows so that they 
         don't overlap (as far as possible). The grid is divided into zones 
         within which one or more windows are arranged. The 'blueprint' for 
         zones on a desktop is called a 'zonemap'. 
      Only 'grid' windows (including the 'main' window, task windows and the 
         automapper window) are arranged on the workspace grid. Temporary
         windows, including the GUI window and all edit, preference, wizard and
         dialogue windows, are not affected.
      The grid is divided into zones. When a window is created in a zone that
         doesn't have room for it, the window is moved up or down into a new 
         'layer'. All windows in the current layer are visible, and some windows
         in lower layers may be visible, if there are no windows above them. All
         windows above the current layer are minimised from the desktop so that
         they're not visible at all.
      This command moves the current layer down one level. To set the current  
         layer directly, use the ';setlayer' command.
