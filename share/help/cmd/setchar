sch / setchar                 Sets the current character
 
   Format:
      ;sch <name>             Sets the current character profile to <name>
      ;sch <name> <pass>      Sets the character profile and password
      ;sch <name> <pass> <account>
                              Sets the character, password and account name
 
   Notes:
      This command sets the current character profile for this session.
      If a profile named <name> doesn't already exist, it is created. If the
         profile already exists, it is made the current character profile.
      If <pass> is specified, a new password is set (or an existing password is
         updated). 
      Some worlds make a distinction between your account name and your
         character's name. If so, you can specify the <account> name associated
         with this character, in which case a new account name is set (or an 
         existing one is updated). 
      Both passwords and account names can also be set in each world profile's 
         'edit' window and in the Connections window.
      The current guild and race profile for the character will also be set, as
         will any current custom profiles for the character.
      Profile names must be no longer than 16 characters, contain only A-Z, a-z, 
         underlines and 0-9 (not the first character) and not be one of Axmud's 
         reserved names (see the ';listreserved' command). Non-Latin alphabets
         are acceptable.
      The operation will fail if <name> is invalid or if there is no current
         world (use the ';setworld' command to set one first).
