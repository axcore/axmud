wcm / worldcompass            Modifies the world's initial Compass task
 
   Format:
      ;wcm <options>          Modifies Compass task parameters

   Notes:
      The Compass task converts your keyboard's keypad (the area on the right
         with mostly number keys) into a device for quickly moving around the
         world. Typically, it converts every press of the '8' key into 'north',
         every press of the '5' key into 'inventory', and so on. (See the help
         for ';read' for more details.)
      The ';compass' command can be used to customise the world commands for
         each keypad key, but it only work on the currently-running Compass
         task. This command modifies both the current Compass task and the
         Compass task stored in the current world's initial tasklist (if any).
         In other words, ';compass' affects the current session, but
         ';worldcompass' can affect this and all future sessions.
      You can use the ';permcompass' command to modify the Compass task in the
         global initial tasklist, rather than the current world's Compass task,
         if you prefer.       
      If you disable world commands using this command, the task will start
         disabled in the future.

      <options> should be one of the following:

         ;wcm on
         ;wcm -o      Enables world commands, so that pressing a keypad key  
                         send a world command
                                
         ;wcm off
         ;wcm -f      Disables world commands, so that keypad keys behave 
                         normally (however, the task keeps running, so world 
                         commands can be re-activated any time you want)

         ;wcm <key> <command>
                      Sets the world <command> send when the <key> is pressed
                                 
         ;wcm <key>   Resets the <key>, so that nothing happens, when it is 
                         pressed   

      <key> can be in several formats. You can use Axmud standard keycodes like 
         'kp_5', the numeral '5' or the word 'five'.
      <command> can be one or more words. If you want to preserve the spacing,
         or if the command begins with one of the instruction sigils (';', ',,',
         '"', '/', '&', ':') can surround the whole command with diamond 
         brackets <...>.
      Note that the task is set up to work at as many muds as possible. Axmud is
         able to 'interpolate' world commands, meaning to convert a general 
         command into one suitable for the current world. You almost certainly
         don't need this, so don't worry about the formatting of world commands 
         like 'loot_room' and 'get,object,all'.

      The full list of <key>s recognised by this command is:
         
         0  zero   kp_0
         5  five   kp_5
         *  times  multiply
         /  slash  divide
         .  dot    fullstop  period
            enter  return

      If you try to customise a keypad <key> like '8', 'eight' or 'kp_8', you'll 
         get a polite refusal.
