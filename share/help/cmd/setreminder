rmd / setreminder             Sets an alert for some time in the future

   Format:
      ;rmd <minutes>          Sets a visual and sound alert

      ;rmd -v <minutes>       Sets a visual alert only
      ;rmd <minutes> -v

      ;rmd -s <minutes>       Sets a sound alert only
      ;rmd <minutes> -s

   Notes:
      This command sets an alert to go off some <minutes> from now. It creates a
         temporary timer. When the timer fires, either a visual or sound alert
         (or both) goes off; the timer then deletes itself.
      For visual alerts, the urgency hint for the session's 'main' window is
         set. The effect of this varies depending on the desktop environment
         you're using. Often, if cases the window to flash in the panel at the
         bottom (or top) of the screen.
      For sound alerts, a standard sound effect is played. You will only be
         able to heard it if sound has been turned on (see the help for
         ';sound').
      If you specify both the '-v' and '-s' switches, the command behaves as
         though you had specified no switches (and both a visual and sound alert
         is set).
      See also the help for ';awayfromkeys'.
