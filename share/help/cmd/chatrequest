chr / chatrequest             Sets up a conference call
 
   Format:
      ;chr -n <name>          Makes request to chat contacts called <name>
      ;chr -g <group>         Makes request to chat contacts in the <group>
      ;chr                    Makes request to everyone
 
   Notes:
      The Chat task is used to chat with other players directly via telnet.
         Calls can be placed (or accepted) with any user whose MUD client uses
         the zChat or MudMaster protocols.
      This command is the equivalent of typing ';request' in the relevant Chat
         task windows and effectively sets up a conference call, asking the chat
         contact for a list of their chat connections and then trying to open a 
         chat session with everyone on that list.
      The chat contact will only reveal connections which have been marked as 
         'public' (connections are 'private' by default). See also the help for 
         the ';chatpeek' command.
      The switches -n and -g can't be combined.
