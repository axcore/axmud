   Notes:
      Most worlds exchange (negotiate) information with the client that isn't 
         usually visible to the user. Some common telnet options include ECHO,
         SGA, TTYPE, EOR and NAWS. In Axmud, all telnet options are enabled by
         default.
      You can use this command to enable and disable telnet options. The action 
         applies to every existing connection (and future ones). 
      Since Axmud negotiates telnet options passively, if you re-enable a telnet
         option after disabling it, the option will still be disabled in 
         existing connections; the change will be applied to all future 
         connections.
         
      Axmud's code uses variables for NEW-ENVIRON and CHARSET, but these telnet
         options haven't been implemented yet.
