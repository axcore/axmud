sct / startcustomtask         Starts a custom task

   Format:
      ;sct <name>             Starts the custom task called <name>

   Notes:
      Custom tasks are created by the user, given a handy name (like 'mytask' or
         'fast_escape') and then started by the user whenever needed.
      In addition, some of the custom task's default settings can be modified.
         For example, if you create a custom Divert task, you can change the
         colours it uses; these colours will then apply every time you start the
         custom task using the ';startcustomtask' command (but the default
         colours will apply if you use ';starttask divert' instead).
      Custom tasks are not associated with any particular world; if you like,
         you can give your custom tasks names like 'deathmud_escape' to remind
         yourself about when to use them.

      This command starts one of the custom tasks created by an earlier
         ';addcustomtask' command.

   User commands:
      sct / startcustomtask
