rmn / repeatmission           Repeats commands from the current mission

   Format:
      ;rmn                    Repeats the previous command
      ;rmn <number>           Repeats the previous <number> commands

   Notes:
      If <number> is specified, the previous commands are repeated in the same
         order they were sent.
      Only world commands and client commands are repeated; comments, breaks and
         login details are ignored (but they still count towards the total
         number of commands repeated, <number>).
      See the help for ';startmission' for more information about missions.
