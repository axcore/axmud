qquit / qquit                 Sends 'quit' but doesn't save files

   Format:
      ;qquit                  Sends the 'quit' command to the world
      ;qquit <minutes>        Sends the 'quit' command after a delay

   Notes:
      Used to terminate the connection naturally (it may take a few moments for
         the world to respond).
      This command initiates the auto-quit sequence. The sequence depends on the
         current world profile's auto-quit mode. The default mode, mode 0, just
         sends a 'quit' command to the world. Other modes can send a sequence of
         world commands, or start a task, Axbasic script or mission to terminate
         the connection.
      By using this command, you will lose any changes you have made to Axmud's
         stored data. Use the ';quit' command to terminate the connection while
         saving files.
