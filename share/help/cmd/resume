resume / resume               Reads aloud the first unread line

   Format:
      ;resume                 Reads aloud the first unread line

   Notes:
      When Axmud is performing text-to-speech, you can use commands like ';skip'
         and ';first' to replay pieces of text.
      While replaying text, any new text received from the world won't be read
         aloud automatically. In that case, you can use this command. It resumes
         reading aloud piece of text automatically, starting with the first
         piece of text that hasn't been read yet.
      Type the command a second time to finish reading aloud new pieces of text,
         and to wait for more text to be received from the world.
      When running the version of Axmud that's optimised for visually-impaired
         users, the tab key can be used as a shortcut to this command (but only
         once Axmud is connected to a world, in online or offline mode.)

      See also the help for ';split', ';unskip', ';last', ';shutup' and
         ';freekeys'.
