aep / addexitpattern          Adds exit pattern to current world profile

   Format:
      ;aep <switch> <pattern>
               Adds an exit <pattern> of the type specified by <switch>

   Notes:
      The Locator task uses exit patterns, defined by the current world profile,
         to spot when a character's attempts to move fail (or when the character
         is moved involuntarily). Every exit pattern is a Perl regular
         expression.
      Because they also appear just after a character move, this command can
         also be used to add a dark room pattern or an unspecified room pattern.
         (Unspecified room patterns match lines received from the world when the
         character has arrived in a new room for which the world hasn't sent a
         new room statement, as it normally would.)

      <switch> must be one of the following:
         -d   Adds a door pattern, e.g. '^You bump into a door!'
         -l   Adds a locked door pattern, e.g. '^It's locked!'
         -f   Adds a failed exit pattern, e.g. '^You can't go that way!'
         -r   Adds a dark room pattern, e.g. '^You can't see a thing!'
         -u   Adds an unspecified room pattern, e.g. '^You land with a thump'
         -i   Adds involuntary exit pattern, e.g. '^You run for your life!'
      <pattern> is the pattern to add. If it already exists, a duplicate pattern
         is not added to the list.

      Most <pattern>s will contain spaces, so you'll need to enclose them within
          diamond brackets <...>
      The Locator task must be reset (usually with the ';resetlocatortask'
          command) or restarted before your changes will take effect.
