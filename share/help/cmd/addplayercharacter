apc / addplayercharacter      Adds a player character (PC) to the world model
 
   Format:
      ;apc <name>             Adds a PC with <name> to the model
      ;apc <name> <parent>    Adds a PC with <name> and parent <parent>
 
   Notes:
      The world model stores information about the regions, rooms, characters
         and objects in the game world. The automapper window uses the model to
         display its maps.
      Most model objects can be added with ';addmodelobject', including player
         characters (model objects which represent a character in the world). 
         Player characters can also be added to the model using command.
      The world model can only contain one object for each character, so you 
         can't add two characters called 'Bilbo'. (All categories of model 
         object except regions and characters can have duplicate names.)
      If <name> is longer than 32 characters, it will be abbreviated.
      <parent>, if specified, is the number of the parent model object. You 
         might possibly want to set the parent to a region or a room but, in 
         most cases, character model objects don't need a parent.
