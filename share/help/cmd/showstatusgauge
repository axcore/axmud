ssg / showstatusgauge         Enables/disables the Status task's gauges

   Format:
      ;ssg                    Enables/disables gauges
      ;ssg                    Enables/disables gauge labels

   Notes:
      Using the data it collects, the Status task can display gauges in the
         'main' window, as well as in its own task window.
      This command enables the gauges if they're not currently visible, or
         disables them if they are visible. If the '-l' switch is specified,
         this command enables or disables drawing labels over the gauges,
         showing the actual numerical values being displayed.

      Other parts of the Axmud code can also create gauges. If you want to
         disable gauges completely, use the ';togglemainwindow -g' command.
