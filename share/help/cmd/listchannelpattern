lchp / listchannelpattern     Lists Channels/Divert task patterns

   Format:
      ;lchp                   Lists all patterns
      ;lchp <channel>         Lists patterns assigned to <channel>
      ;lchp -e                Lists exception patterns

   Notes:
      The Channels and Divert tasks intercept text received from the world and
         divert that text into their own task window. Sometimes the text is
         gagged, meaning that it's displayed in the 'main' window too. You can't
         run both tasks at the same time.
      The world profile stores a list of patterns. When a line of text which
         matches one of those patterns is received, it is diverted to the task
         window.
      Each pattern is also assigned a channel. (See the help for
         ';addchannelpattern' for a longer explanation.)

      This command lists the channel patterns stored in the current world
         profile. You'll notice that the list is a numbered list; you'll need to
         know a pattern's number before you can use ';deletechannelpattern' to
         delete it.
