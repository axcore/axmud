scs / setcharset              Specifies the character set to use

   Format:
      ;scs                    Shows current and available character sets
      ;scs -d <charset>       Sets the default character set
      ;scs -w <charset>       Sets the current world's character set
      ;scs -w                 Resets the current world's character set

   Notes:
      The most useful character sets for modern telnet clients are
         'iso-8859-1', 'utf8', 'utf-8-strict' and 'cp437'.
      Each session (connection) uses the character set specified by the current
         world profile.
      If the world profile doesn't specify a character set, Axmud's default
         character set, 'iso-8859-1', is used.

      There are probably only two reasons why you might want to change the
         character set:

         1. You're connecting to a world that uses graphical characters from the
               Code page 437 ('cp437') set
         2. You're connecting to a world using a different alphabet altogether

      If specified, <charset> must be typed exactly and with the correct
         capitalisation; for example, the first of these commands is correct,
         but the second will generate an error:

            ;setcharset -d iso-8859-1
            ;setcharset -d ISO-8859-1

      To see the current character set in action, use the ';dumpascii' command.

   User commands:
      scs / setcharset
