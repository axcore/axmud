   Notes:
      Winmaps are a plan for arranging the layout of 'internal' windows 
         (consisting of all 'main' windows, 'protocol' windows such as those 
         created by MXP, and 'custom' windows such as task windows).
      See the help for ';addwinmap' for more information about winmaps, and see
         the help for ';addwinzone' for more information about winzones.
