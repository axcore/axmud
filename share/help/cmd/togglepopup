tpp / togglepopup             Toggles popup windows
 
   Format:
      ;tpp                    Toggles popup windows
      
   Notes:
      Axmud is able to open a popup window when it's doing something that takes
         several seconds - loading a large file, or drawing a large map, for
         example.
      If you'd prefer not to see popup windows at all, you can use this command
         to turn them off (or back on again).
