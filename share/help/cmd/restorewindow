rwn / restorewindow           Restores windows to their former size/position
 
   Format:
      ;rwn                    Restores the size and position of all windows
      ;rwn <number>           Restores the size and position of window <number>
 
   Notes:
      The workspace grid is an invisible grid, spanning the whole available
         workspace, on which Axmud tries to arrange its windows so that they 
         don't overlap (as far as possible). The grid is divided into zones 
         within which one or more windows are arranged. The 'blueprint' for 
         zones on a desktop is called a 'zonemap'. 
      Only 'grid' windows (including the 'main' window, task windows and the 
         automapper window) are arranged on the workspace grid. Temporary
         windows, including the object viewer window and all edit, preference,
         wizard and dialogue windows, are not affected.

      Users are free to drag 'grid' windows around the desktop, to resize them
         manually or even to move them to other workspaces. This command 
         restores one or more windows to their size and position when they were
         last placed on a workspace grid.
      A window's <number> can be obtained from the ';listwindow' command.
