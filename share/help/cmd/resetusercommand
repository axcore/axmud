ruc / resetusercommand        Resets the user command list
 
   Format:
      ;ruc                    Resets user commands to the default list
 
   Notes:
      All client commands have a single standard form (for example, this 
         command's standard form is 'resetusercommand').
      Some of the standard forms for client commands are quite long, so Axmud
          allows the user to create abbreviated versions called 'user commands'.
      This command resets the user commands, removing any changes you have made 
          using ';addusercommand' and ';deleteusercommand'
      (See the help for ';addusercommand' for more information about user
         commmands.)
 
   User commands:
      ruc / resetuc / resetusercmd / resetusercommand
