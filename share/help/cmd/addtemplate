atm / addtemplate             Adds a new profile template
 
   Format:
      ;atm <category>         Adds a template called <category>
 
   Notes:
      The blueprint for a new category of profile is called a profile template.
         Several custom profiles can be based on a single template.
      Standard profiles have the category 'world', 'guild', 'race' or 'char'.
         Custom profiles have the category of the template on which they're
         based. This command creates a new profile template from which any 
         number of profiles with the same <category> can be created.
      Category names must be no longer than 16 characters, contain only A-Z, 
         a-z, underlines and 0-9 (not the first character) and not be one of 
         Axmud's reserved names (see the ';listreserved' command). Non-Latin
         alphabets are acceptable.
      You shouldn't use a <category> name that you might want to use as a 
         profile name, some time in the future.
      (See the help for ';listprofile' for more information about profiles.)
