rt / resumetask               Resumes a paused task

   Format:
      ;rt <task>              Resumes <task>
      ;rt -a                  Resumes all currently paused tasks
      ;rt                     Resumes all tasks paused with the ';pausetask'

   Notes:
      <task> can be any Axmud built-in or external task that's currently
         running.
      <task> can be in the form of a task's label (e.g. 'stat, 'status'), its
         formal name (e.g. 'status_task') or the task's unique name (e.g.
         'status_task_4').
      (Use the ';listtasklabel' command to list all task labels.)
      If there is more than one task matching <task>, they will all be resumed.

      ';rt <task>' and ';rt all' are debugging commands. It's not recommended to
         force all your paused tasks to resume, as they may have been paused for
         a good reason. Stick to ';rt' (without any arguments) and you'll avoid
         unexpected problems.

   User commands:
      rt / resumetask
