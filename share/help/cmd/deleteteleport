dlt / deleteteleport          Deletes an existing teleport location
 
   Format:
      ;dlt <room>             Deletes the teleport destination called <room>
 
   Notes:
      The ';teleport' command is a convenient way of jumping around any world
         which implements some kind of teleportation system (in which you can 
         jump to a destination room from many different departure rooms). 
      The advantage of using that client command, rather than typing a world
         command like 'portal tower', is that the automapper won't get lost when
         you use ';teleport'.

      The ';addteleport' command is used to add a teleport destination to 
         Axmud's world model. This command can be used to delete a teleport 
         destination.
      <room> is a name for the destination room, which is often the same as a 
         room tag in the world model, or the same as the unique model number of 
         a room in the world model. 
      A full explanation of how this works can be found in the help for the
         ';teleport' command. See also the help for ';addteleport' and
         ';listteleport'.

   User commands:
      dlt / delport / deleteteleport
