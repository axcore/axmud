lkc / listkeycode             Lists keycodes for the current system
 
   Format:
      ;lkc                    Lists all keycodes (in the normal order)
      ;lkc -s                 Lists all keycodes (sorted alphabetically)
 
   Notes:
       Keycodes are used by the system to recognise the keys on your keyboard.
         For example, the F5 key usually has the keycode 'F5', and the two SHIFT 
         keys often have the keycodes 'Shift_L' and 'Shift_R'.
      Keycodes vary between systems, so Axmud offers a set of standard keycodes
         (for example 'f5' and 'shift'). Axmud represents two keys pressed down
         together as a keycode string like 'shift f5' or 'ctrl c'. 
      Axmud's standard keycodes are mostly used with macros; they allow you to 
         design macros that will work on all systems, not just the one you're 
         using right now.
         
      This command lists Axmud's standard keycodes and the equivalent keycodes
         on your current system.
      Use ';listkeycodealternative' to get a list of alternative forms for 
         Axmud's standard keycodes.
