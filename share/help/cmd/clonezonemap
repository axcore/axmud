czm / clonezonemap            Clones a zonemap
 
   Format:
      ;czm <old> <new>
               Clones the zonemap <old> into one named <new>
 
   Notes:
      Zonemaps are a plan for arranging windows on a workspace grid. Zonemaps
         contain one or more zone models, describing a region of the workspace 
         and the kinds of window that region is allowed to contain.
      Axmud provides a number of standard zonemaps which cannot be modified, but
         you can use this command to create a clone, and the clone can be 
         modified freely.
      <new> must be no longer than 16 characters, and contain only A-Z, a-z, 
         underlines and 0-9 (not the first character).
      The MXP protocol, if enabled, can create temporary zonemaps to arrange 
         windows in the way the world specifies. Temporary zonemaps cannot be
         cloned.

   User commands:
      czm / clonezm / clonezonemap
