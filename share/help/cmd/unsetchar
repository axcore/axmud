uch / unsetchar               Unsets the current character

   Format:
      ;uch                    Unsets the current character profile

   Notes:
      After using this command, there will be no current character profile. All
         interfaces used by the character will become unavailable. (They will be
         restored the next time this character is made current.)
      If the character has been assigned a current guild, current race or any
         current custom profiles, they too will be unset.
      You can select the next current character with the ';setchar' command.
