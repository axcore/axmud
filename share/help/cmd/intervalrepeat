irp / intervalrepeat          Sends a world command multiple times at intervals

   Format:
      ;irp <number> <time> <cmd>
                              Sends the <cmd> at intervals

   Notes:
      The command <cmd> is sent <number> times at intervals of <time> seconds.
      All the text following <time> is used as a single command, so you don't
         need to enclose it in diamond brackets:

            e.g. ';intervalrepeat 10 1 unlock door with key;open door;north'

      However, you can still use diamond brackets to preserve unusual spacing
         (if you really want to):

            e.g. ';intervalrepeat 10 1 <say hello...         and who are you?>'

      To send a command multiple times without intervals, use the ';repeat'
         command. To stop sending these commands early, use ';stopcommand'.

       Speedwalking is often a more convenient way of achieving the same thing
         (see the help for ';speedwalk').

   User commands:
      irp / intrep / intervalrepeat
