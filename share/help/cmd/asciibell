asb / asciibell               Turns ASCII bells on/off
 
   Format:
      ;asb on                 Turns ASCII bells on
      ;asb off                Turns ASCII bells off
      ;asb                    Shows whether ASCII bells are on or off
 
   Notes:       
      Some worlds send the ASCII character #7, for which the client should play
         some kind of beep/bell sound. 
      This command turns ASCII bells on and off. If ASCII bells are turned on
         but sound is turned off in general, you won't hear anything (see the 
         help for ';sound').
         
   User commands:
