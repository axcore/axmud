lim / listinterfacemodel      Lists default interface settings
 
   Format:
      ;lim                    Lists all five interface models
      ;lim -t                 Shows the trigger interface model
      ;lim -a                 Shows the alias interface model

   Notes:
      Axmud interfaces are triggers, aliases, macros, timers and hooks. 
      Interface models contain default settings for interfaces; this command
         lists some of those settings.
      As well as the switches above, the words 'trig', 'trigger', 'alias',
         'macro', 'timer' and 'hook' can be used.
