tir / toggleirreversible      Toggles irreversible icons in 'edit' windows
 
   Format:
      ;tir                    Toggles irreversible icons      
      ;tir -t                 Tests irreversible icons
      
   Notes:
      When you make changes to Axmud's data using an 'edit' window, the changes
         are not normally applied until you click 'Save' or 'OK' at the bottom
         of the window.
      However, some buttons apply a change immediately. Axmud provides a special
         icon, a purple diamond, which is shown in all buttons which apply a
         change immediately.
      Unfortunately, many systems don't permit buttons to have both text and an
         icon, so this feature is disabled by default, and a text replacement
         in the form of (*) is used.
      You can use the '-t' switch to test whether your system can display text
         and icons in the same button. A 'dialogue' window appears; if you can
         see the purple icon, it's safe to enable that icon in all 'edit'
         windows.
