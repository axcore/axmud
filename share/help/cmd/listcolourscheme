lcs / listcolourscheme        Lists colour schemes
 
   Format:

   Notes:
      A textview is a scrolling area of a window where text is displayed. A
         colour scheme determines the colours and font used in the textview.
      Axmud provides a standard set of colour schemes, one for each window type.
         These colour schemes can be modified but not deleted.
      This command lists colour schemes and their colours/fonts.
