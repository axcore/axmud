scb / setcommandbuffer        Sets the size of world command buffers

   Format:
      ;scb <size>             Sets the buffer <size>
      ;scb                    Sets the buffer size to 1000

   Notes:
      World command buffers are Axmud's records of individual commands sent to
         the world (see the help for ';commandbuffer').
      Every session has its own world command buffer, storing world commands
         sent by that session. There is also a combined world command buffer
         storing world commands sent by all sessions.

      All world command buffers have the same size, which can be changed with
         this command. If specified, <size> must be an integer in the range
         10-1000000.

   User commands:
      scb / setcmdbuff / setcommandbuffer
