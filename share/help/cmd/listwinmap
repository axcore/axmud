lwm / listwinmap              Lists all winmaps
 
   Format:
      ;lwm                    Lists winmaps
      ;lwm -s                 Lists only standard winmaps
      ;lwm <name>             Shows properties of winmap <name>
 
   Notes:
      Winmaps are a plan for arranging the layout of 'internal' windows 
         (consisting of all 'main' windows, 'protocol' windows such as those 
         created by MXP, and 'custom' windows such as task windows).
      See the help for ';addwinmap' for more information about winmaps.

      The basic list shows how many winzones each winmap contains (each winzone 
         is an area available to be occupied by a single table object), and 
         whether the winmap is full of winzones, or not.
      The -s switch restricts the list to Axmud's standard winmaps (which can't 
         be modified or deleted).

      If you specify a winmap <name>, the specified winmap's properties and a
         list of its strip objects are displayed. For a list of the winmap's
         winzones, and their properties, use the ';listwinzone' command.
