slf / setlife                 Sets the Status task's current life status
 
   Format:
      ;slf <switch>           Sets character's life status
      ;slf <status>           Sets character's life status

   Notes:
      This command updates the current character's life status, as displayed by
         the current Status task. (Updating the task also updates the life
         status stored in the current character profile.)
      Your character's life status - 'alive', 'sleep', 'passout' or 'dead' - is
         normally set automatically by triggers. If the Status task is showing 
         the wrong life status, it's possible to edit the current character 
         profile manually (before resetting the Status task), but it's usually 
         quicker to use this command.

      <switch> can be any of the following:
         -a   - character is alive
         -s   - character is asleep
         -p   - character is passed out
         -d   - character is dead
      Alternatively, you can use any of the following <status> strings:
         'alive', 'sleep', 'passout', 'dead'.

      Note that, when the current character's life status is updated because of
         one of the Status task's triggers (for example, when the trigger reacts 
         to a pattern that means your character has died), certain events happen 
         (such as writing special log files). Those events don't take place if
         you change the character's life status with this command (or if you 
         edit the current character profile manually.)
