div / disactivateinventory    Disactivates the Inventory/Condition tasks

   Format:
      ;div                    Disactivate the tasks

   Notes:
      When the Inventory task is in 'active' mode, it sends commands such as
         'inventory' to the world at regular intervals, waits for the response
         and then displays a list of objects from the character's inventory in
         the task window.
      When the Condition task is in 'active' mode, it sends commands such as
         'examine axe' to the world at regular intervals, waits for the response
         and then updates the Inventory task's list of objects (the Condition
         task won't run without the Inventory task).
      If the Inventory and Condition tasks are both running, this command
         disactivates them both. If only the Inventory task is running, it
         disactivates just that task.
      Both the Inventory and Condition tasks are in 'active' mode when they
         start (by default). After using this command to disactivate them, use
         the ';activateinventory' command to re-activate them.

   User commands:
