rll / resetlightlist          Resets the list of recognised light status values

   Format:
      ;rll                    Resets the list

   Notes:
      Worlds will often present different verbose room descriptions, depending
         on the time of day in the game world and how much light is illuminating
         the character's location.
      Axmud represents current conditions with a 'light status' (stored in the
         world model). There are three standard values for the light status
         ('day', 'night' and 'dark'). New values can be added with the
         ';setlightlist' command; this command reset the list to its default
         values.

   User commands:
      rll / resetlightlist
