spm / setprotectedmoves       Turns protected moves on/off

   Format:
      ;spm on                 Turns protected moves on
      ;spm off                Turns protected moves off
      ;spm                    Shows whether protected moves are on or off

   Notes:
      When protected moves are on, Axmud will not send world commands like
         'east' or 'out' through exits which are marked as impassable, or which
         haven't been added to your maps - as long as the automapper knows the
         character's current location. Using protected moves may reduce the
         number of times that you have to reset the automapper's current room
         manually.
      Protected moves can be turned on and off from the automapper window's menu
         or by using this command.
      Protected moves are not available when 'redirect mode' is turned on (see
         the help for ';redirectmode').

   User commands:
      spm / setpm / setprotectedmove / setprotectedmoves
