mcall / chatmcall             Calls someone using the MudMaster protocol
 
   Format:
      ;mcall <ip>             Calls someone on the default port
      ;mcall <ip> <port>      Calls someone on the specified <port>
 
   Notes:
      The Chat task is used to chat with other players directly via telnet.
         Calls can be placed (or accepted) with any user whose MUD client uses
         the zChat or MudMaster protocols.
      This command opens a chat session using the MudMaster chat protocol. A new 
         Chat task is created, if necessary.
      To call using the zChat protocol, use the ';chatzcall' command. To call
         someone on your contacts list, use the ';chatcall' command.
 
   User commands:
      mcall / chatmcall
