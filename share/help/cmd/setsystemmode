ssm / setsystemmode           Starts or configures the System task
 
   Format:
      ;ssm                    Starts the task or displays current task modes
      ;ssm <switches>         Starts the task and/or modifies task modes
 
   Notes:
      The System task diverts (or copies) system messages into a separate task
         window.
      There are five types of system message: a system text message (for
         example, the response to the ';about' command), error messages,
         warning messages, debug messages and (for Axmud internal errors)
         improper arguments messages.
      For each type of system message, the task can operate in three modes - to
         display the message in the 'main' window only, or in the task window
         only, or in both (the default mode). When the task isn't running,
         system messages are only displayed in the 'main' window.
         
      If no <switches> are specified, the current System task's modes are
         listed; but if the task is not running, it is started using its default
         modes instead.
      If <switches> are specified, the current task's modes are modified; but if
         the task is not running, it is started using the specified mode(s).
         
      <switches> can specify one or more types of system message:
         -s   System text messages
         -e   Error messages
         -w   Warning messages
         -d   Debug messages
         -i   Improper messages
         -a   All system messages
      <switches>, if specified at all, must also include exactly one mode
         setting:
         -m   the system message(s) are displayed in 'main' window only (what 
                 happens when the System task is not running)
         -b   the system message(s) are displayed in both the 'main' and task 
                 windows (the default mode, when the System task is running)
         -t   the system message(s) are displayed in the task window only
      You can specify several types of system message, but only one mode, e.g.

         ;setsystemmode -e -w -m

   User commands:
      ssm / systemmode / setsystemmode
