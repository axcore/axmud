amc / addmodifierchar         Adds a speedwalk modifier character
 
   Format:
      ;amc <char> <cmd>       Adds a modifier <char> for a standard <cmd>
      
   Notes:
      Speedwalking is a method of moving from one location in the world to
         another with a minimum of typing.
      Speedwalk commands can be typed in the 'main' window's command entry box.
         These commands start with the speedwalk sigil, a full stop/period
         character:
      
         .3ne2s
   
      ...which is the equivalent of typing 'north;north;north;east;south;south'.
         See the help for ';speedwalk' for a full explanation of Axmud's
         speedwalking capabilities.
         
      Modifier characters are upper-case characters which modify the lower-case
         movement command that follows them, for example:

         .w             > west         
         .Ow            > open west door
      
      <char> can be any letter in the range A-Z (the character is automatically
         converted to upper case for you). Non-Latin alphabets are acceptable.
      
      <cmd> should be one of the standard commands used by Axmud's command
         cages.
      In the example above, the modifier character 'O' corresponds to the 
         standard command 'open_dir'.
      Standard commands are never modified. Each command cage stores the same
         set of standard commands, and a corresponding list of replacement
         commands which can be modified. 
      For example, the standard command 'open_dir' corresponds to the 
         replacement command 'open direction door' by default. When Axmud uses
         this standard command, it removes the word 'direction' and replaces it
         with direction it wants to use, for example 'open west door'.
      Any standard command can be used with this command, but the most useful
         ones - those whose replacement commands contain a 'direction' by
         default - are:
         
         'go_dir', 'run', 'walk', 'fly', 'swim', 'dive', 'sail', 'ride',
         'drive', 'creep', 'sneak', 'squeeze'
         
         'open_dir', 'close_dir', 'unlock', 'lock', 'pick', 'break'

      You can use the ';listmodifierchar' command to see a list of the current
         dictionary's speedwalk modifier characters, as well as their equivalent
         standard and replacement commands from the current highest-priority
         command cage.
