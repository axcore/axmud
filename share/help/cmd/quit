quit / quit                   Sends 'quit' and saves files
 
   Format:
      ;quit                   Sends the 'quit' command to the world
      ;quit <minutes>         Sends the 'quit' command after a delay
 
   Notes:
      Used to terminate the connection naturally (it may take a few moments for 
         the world to respond).
      This command initiates the auto-quit sequence. The sequence depends on the
         current world profile's auto-quit mode. The default mode, mode 0, just 
         sends a 'quit' command to the world. Other modes can send a sequence of 
         world commands, or start a task, Axbasic script or mission to terminate 
         the connection.
      ';quit' automatically save data files. Use the ';qquit' command to
         terminate the connection naturally without saving any files. Use the
         ';quitall' command to terminate the connection in all worlds.
