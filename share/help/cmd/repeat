rp / repeat                   Sends a world command multiple times

   Format:
      ;rp <number> <cmd>      Sends the <cmd>, <number> times

   Notes:
      All of the text following <number> is used as a single command, so you
         don't need to enclose it in diamond brackets:

            e.g. ';repeat 10 unlock door with key;open door;north'

      However, you can still use diamond brackets to preserve unusual spacing
         (if you really want to):

            e.g. ';repeat 10 <say hello...         and who are you?>'

      To repeat the same command at intervals, use the ';intervalrepeat'
         command.
      To stop sending these commands early, use ';stopcommand'.

      Speedwalking is often a more convenient way of achieving the same thing
         (see the help for ';speedwalk').

   User commands:
      rp / repeat
