hint / hint                   Shows the current world's hint text again
 
   Format:
      ;hint                   Shows the warning text
 
   Notes:
      The first time you connect to certain pre-configured worlds, you'll see a
         'dialogue' window containing hint(s) about the current world; usually a
         reminder of things to do, before Axmud's automapper will work.
      You can see the same hint again by typing this command at any time.
   
   User commands:
