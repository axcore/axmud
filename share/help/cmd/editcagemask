emk / editcagemask            Opens an 'edit' window for a cage mask
 
   Format:
      ;emk <name>             Opens an 'edit' window for the cage mask <name>
 
   Notes:
      Cage masks are a way of initialising (or resetting) a task's settings and
         parameters depending on which profiles are current profiles. Axmud's
         code does not contain any cage masks at the moment, though it may in 
         the future.
      <name> is the full name of the cage mask.
