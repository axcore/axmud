cb / commandbuffer            Shows the status of a world command buffer
 
   Format:
      ;cb -s                  Shows session's buffer status
      ;cb                     

      ;cb -c                  Shows status of client's combined buffer 
 
   Notes:
      World command buffers are Axmud's records of individual commands sent to 
         the world (if you type 'north;kill orc;eat corpse', that counts as 
         three separate world commands).
      Every session has its own world command buffer, storing world commands 
         sent by that session. There is also a combined world command buffer
         storing world commands sent by all sessions.

      Each world command has its own entry, or 'item', in the buffer. The number 
         of the items in the combined buffer and session buffers won't match if
         there is more than one session open.
      This command shows basic information about one of the buffers. To show the
         buffer's contents, use the ';dumpcommandbuffer' command.

   User commands:
      cb / cmdbuff / commandbuffer
