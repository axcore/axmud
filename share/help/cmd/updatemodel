umd / updatemodel             Updates the world model's lists of unknown words
 
   Format:
      ;umd                    Updates the world model
      ;umd -t                 Updates the world model, truncating output
 
   Notes:
      The world model stores information about the regions, rooms, characters
         and objects in the game world. The automapper window uses the model to
         display its maps.
      When objects (not including regions and rooms) are added to the world 
         model, words are extracted from their base descriptions and stored as 
         nouns and adjectives. For example, from the object 'big hairy orc' we 
         might be able to extract the noun 'orc' and the adjectives 'big' and 
         'hairy'.
      However, words which the current dictionary doesn't recognise are stored
         in each object as unknown words. As the dictionary is expanded, the
         unknown word lists stored in world model objects become out of date.
      This command checks the unknown words, re-classifying any that the current
         dictionary now recognises.
      A list of re-classified words is displayed in the 'main' window. To hide 
         the list, use the '-t' switch.
