ufw / unflashwindow           Resets a 'grid' window's urgency hint
 
   Format:
      ;ufw <number>           Stops window <number> flashing
      ;ufw                    Stops the session's 'main' window flashing
 
   Notes:
      The effect of setting a window's urgency hint varies depending on the
         desktop environment you're using. Often, it causes the window to flash
         in the panel at the bottom (or top) of the screen. This command resets
         the urgency hint, which should stop a window from flashing.
      This command can be used even if ';flashwindow' wasn't the cause of a 
         flashing window.
      For a list of 'grid' window <number>s, use the ';listwindow' command.
