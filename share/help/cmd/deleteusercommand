duc / deleteusercommand       Deletes a user command

   Format:
      ;duc <user_command>     Deletes a user command

   Notes:
      All client commands have a standard form, called the 'standard command'
          (for example, this command's standard form is 'deleteusercommand').
      Some of the standard commands are quite long, so Axmud allows the user to
          create abbreviated versions called 'user commands'.
      This command deletes one of those user commands - either one of the
         built-in user commands or one you created yourself by using
         ';addusercommand'.

      You can't delete a user command that's exactly the same as its
         corresponding standard command (because Axmud's internal code also uses
         them).
      (See the help for ';addusercommand' for more information about user
         commmands.)

   User commands:
