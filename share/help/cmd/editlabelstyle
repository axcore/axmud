els / editlabelstyle          Opens an 'edit' window for a map label style
 
   Format:
      ;els <name>             Edits the style
 
   Notes:
      Map labels are drawn in the automapper window. It's possible to customise
         labels individually, but most labels are drawn using a map label style
         (so that when the style is changed, all labels using that style are
         redrawn automatically).
      <name> is the name of the style to edit. If it contains spaces, you should
         enclose the name in diamond brackets <...>.
