rsm / resetsmiley             Resets Chat task smileys to the default list

   Format:
      ;rsm                    Resets the smiley list

   Notes:
      For the benefit of Axmud users under the age of ten, the Chat task
         automatically converts smileys such as :) and ;) into colourful icons
         (unless this behaviour has been turned off by using the
         ';chatsetsmiley off' command).
      This command resets Axmud's list of smileys to the default list.

   User commands:
      rsm / resetsmily / resetsmiley
