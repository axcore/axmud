road / road                   Moves the character using pre-defined road routes
 
   Format:
      ;road <start> <stop>    Moves from the room <start> to the room <stop>
      ;road <stop>            Moves from the current room to the room <stop>
 
   Notes:
      Axmud pre-defined routes are an easy way to move between rooms in the game
         world (see the help for ';addroute' for information about routes).
      This command moves the character between two rooms - whose room tags are
         <start> and <stop> - using only pre-defined 'road' routes. 
      If the Locator task already knows the current room's tag (i.e. if you can 
         see the tag in the task window), you can omit <start>.
      If there is no pre-defined route between <start> and <stop>, Axmud will 
         try to work out the shortest path between the rooms by combining other
         pre-defined routes.

      This command uses only road routes. You can use the ';quick' command to 
         move using only quick routes, or you can use the ';drive' command to 
         move using both road and quick routes. The ';circuit' command can be
         used to move along a circuit route.
      You can also use the ';go' command to move around the world using the 
         automapper and the world model.
