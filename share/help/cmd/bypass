byp / bypass                  Interprets a bypass string as a world command
 
   Format:
      ;byp <string>           Interprets the <string>
      
   Notes:
      Bypass commands can be typed in the 'main' window's command entry box. 
         These commands start with the bypass sigil, a 'greater than' character:
      
         >drink water
                  
      Everything after the sigil is interpreted as a world command. However,
         unlike normal world commands, a bypass command is sent to the world
         immediately, bypassing any world commands which have been queued
         (because of the current world profile's slowwalking settings or because
         crawl mode is on).
         
      Bypass sigils are turned off by default (use ';togglesigil -b' to turn 
         them on again). However, this client command is always available, and 
         you don't need to type the sigil:
         
         ;bypass drink water
         
      If you want to preserve spacing between words, you can enclose the whole
         <string> in diamond brackets <...>:
         
         ;bypass <say Hello...      I'm back!>
          
   User commands:
      byp / bypass
