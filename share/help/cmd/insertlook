ilk / insertlook              Inserts fake 'look' into the Locator movement list
 
   Format:
      ;ilk                    Insert the fake look
 
   Notes:
      The Locator task keeps track of the number of look, glance and movement
         commands sent to the world, so it knows how many room statements to
         expect. Any part of the code can then check the character is where they
         are supposed to be, by checking whether the Locator task is not
         expecting any more room statement.
      Unfortunately, some worlds send an unsolicited room statement for certain
         events, and this disrupts the Locator task's operations.
      This command inserts an artificial 'look' command into the Locator task,
         which causes it to expect an extra room statement. The command is
         normally used with a trigger, whose stimulus is a pattern like

            The sun has risen on a beautiful new day

         ...and whose response is this client command. Hopefully, the artificial
         look is inserted before the Locator task interprets the room statement.
