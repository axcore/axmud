dtm / deletetemplate          Deletes a profile template
 
   Format:
      ;dtm <category>         Deletes the profile template <category>
 
   Notes:
      The blueprint for a new category of profile is called a profile template. 
         Several custom profiles can be based on a single template.
      Standard profiles have the category 'world', 'guild', 'race' or 'char'.
         Custom profiles have the category of the template on which they're
         based. This command removes an existing template from which any number 
         of profiles with the same <category> could have been created.
      The operation will fail if any custom profiles based on the template still 
         exist (you will need to delete the custom profiles before you try to 
         delete the template on which they're based.)
      Category names must be no longer than 16 characters, contain only A-Z, 
         a-z, underlines and 0-9 (not the first character) and not be one of 
         Axmud's reserved names (see the ';listreserved' command).
      (See the help for ';listprofile' for more information about profiles.)
