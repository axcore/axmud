   Notes:
      Axmud interfaces are triggers, aliases, macros, timers and hooks.
      Interfaces can be exported and imported between profiles (for example,
         between two different world profiles).
      When exporting (for example, using ';exporttrigger', the interfaces are
         stored temporarily in Axmud's own interface clipboard. This command
         empties the clipboard.
      See also the help for ';listclipboard'.
