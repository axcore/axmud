dsl / disablesaveload         Disables saving/loading of all files
 
   Format:
      ;dsl                    Disables saving/loading
 
   Notes:
      If Axmud encounters a serious error while saving or loading a file, it
         automatically disables the saving and loading of files across all
         sessions. This should prevent your saved data from getting corrupted.
      For this reason, once all file saving/loading has been disabled, it will 
         not be re-enabled until you restart Axmud.
      You can use this command to manually disable file saving/loading. You can
         also use ';disablesaveworld' to disable saving files associated with a
         particular world.
      Even after using this command, the ';emergencysave' command will still be
         available.
