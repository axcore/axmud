act / addcustomtask           Adds a task to the custom tasklist
 
   Format:
      ;act <task> <name>
               Adds the <task> to the custom tasklist
      ;act <task> <name> <switches>
               Adds the <task> to the custom tasklist with the specified
                  settings
 
   Notes:
      Custom tasks are created by the user, given a handy name (like 'mytask' or
         'fast_escape') and then started by the user whenever needed.
      In addition, some of the custom task's default settings can be modified.
         For example, if you create a custom Divert task, you can change the
         colours it uses; these colours will then apply every time you start the
         custom task using the ';startcustomtask' command (but the default 
         colours will apply if you use ';starttask divert' instead).
      Custom tasks are not associated with any particular mud; if you like, you
         can give your custom tasks names like 'deathmud_escape' to remind
         yourself about when to use them.

      <task> can be any Axmud built-in or external task.
      <task> can be in the form of a task's label (e.g. 'stat', 'status') or its
          formal name (e.g. 'status_task').
      (Use the ';listtasklabel' command to list all task labels.)

      Custom task names must be no longer than 16 characters, contain only A-Z, 
         a-z, underlines and 0-9 (not the first character) and not be one of 
         Axmud's reserved names (see the ';listreserved' command). Non-Latin
         alphabets are acceptable.
      The operation will fail if a custom task called <name> already exists or 
         if <name> is invalid.

      <switches> specify the settings that will apply to the task, once it 
         actually starts.
      Group 1 <switches>: 0 or 1 switch from:
         -i               - Start <task> immediately (default setting)
         -e <other_task>  - Wait for <other_task> to exist, before starting 
                               <task>
         -n <other_task>  - Wait for <other_task> to not exist, before starting
                               <task>
         -s <other_task>  - Wait for <other_task> to start, then stop, before
                               starting <task>
         -t <minutes>     - Start <task> <minutes> from now
 
      Group 2 <switches>: 0 or 1 switch from:
         -d               - Run <task> for an unlimited amount of time (default)
         -f <minutes>     - Run the task for <minutes>
         -u <timer>       - Run the task until the task loop reaches <timer>
                               (seconds since the session began) 
 
      Group 3 <switches>: 0 or 1 switch from: 
         -w               - Run the task without opening its own window (if it
                               usually opens one when it starts)
 
   User commands:
      act / addcustomtask
