dds / deletesecondary         Deletes a secondary direction

   Format:
      ;dds <custom>           Deletes the direction

   Notes:
      Axmud provides eighteen 'standard' primary directions - the sixteen
         compass directions (including 'north', 'northeast' and
         'northnortheast') as well as 'up' and 'down'. This standard set never
         changes.
      Axmud dictionaries store a custom set of primary directions, one for each
         standard direction. Dictionaries also store a set of secondary
         directions such as 'out' and 'in', this set can contain as many or as
         few directions as you want.
      For a list of primary and secondary directions stored in the current
         dictionary, use the 'listdirection' command.

      This command deletes the secondary direction <custom>. You can replace it
         with the ';addsecondary' commmand, if you want.
