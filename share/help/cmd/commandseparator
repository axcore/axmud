csp / commandseparator        Sets the command separator

   Format:
      ;csp <string>           Sets the command separator to <string>
      ;csp                    Sets the command separator to its default value

   Notes:
      When you type a world command like 'north;open door;east', Axmud splits
         the string into three separate commands before sending them to the
         world, one at a time.
      The default command separator is the ';' character, but you can specify
         any sequence of characters (up to a maximum of four).

   User commands:
      csp / cmdsep / commandseparator
