irc / insertrecording         Sets the insertion point for the current recording

   Format:
      ;irc <number>           Sets the insertion point to line <number>
      ;irc                    Cancels the insertion point

   Notes:
      When a recording is in progress, new commands are normally added to the
         end of the recording. If you want to add commmands somewhere else, use
         this command to create an insertion point at line <number>. Line
         numbers can be found with the ';listrecording' command.
      If you don't specify a line number, the insertion point is cancelled and
         all new commands will be added to the end of the recording.
      See the help for the ';record' command for more information about
         recordings.
