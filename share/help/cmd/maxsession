mxs / maxsession              Sets the maximum number of concurrent sessions
 
   Format:
      ;mxs <number>           Sets the maximum sessions to <number>
 
   Notes:
      Axmud limits the maximum number of sessions (separate tabs in the 'main'
         window) to a sensible number. 
      The absolute maximum is 1024, but the normal maximum is 16. If you are 
         running the version of Axmud that's optimised for visually-impaired
         users, the maximum is 1. In either case, you can change the maximum
         number, if you want to. <number> should be an integer in the range
         1-1024.

   User commands:
