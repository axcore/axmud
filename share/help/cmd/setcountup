scu / setcountup              Sets a countdown, counting up from zero

   Format:
      ;scu                    Starts the Countdown task
      ;scu <num>              Counts up <num> seconds
      ;scu -s <num>           Counts up <num> seconds
      ;scu -m <num>           Counts up <num> minutes
      ;scu -h <num>           Counts up <num> hours

   Notes:
      This commands starts the Countdown task, or uses an existing one (if one
         is running, and is not already counting down or up).
      The task counts up from zero until it reaches the time you specify. The
         arguments can occur in any order, so all of these are acceptable:

         ;scu 60
         ;scu -s 60
         ;scu 60 -s

      The maximum time allowed is 99, 59 minutes and 59 seconds. If you
         specify a longer time, the maximum is used instead.
      If you don't specify a time and no Countdown task is running, one is
         started. You can use the task window to start the clock as soon as
         you're ready.
      See also the help for ';setcountdown', which counts down from a specified
         time until zero is reached.

   User commands:
