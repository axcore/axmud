crc / copyrecording           Shows recording's commands as a single line

   Format:
      ;crc                    Shows the recording's commands

   Notes:
      ';listrecording' displays the contents of the recording, with one command
         per line. That's convenient for editing the recording, but for
         copy-and-paste operations (such as creating a new alias), it's more
         useful to display all the commands on a single line.
      ';copyrecording' lists all the world commands in the recording, from
         beginning to end, but omits client commands, comments and breaks.
      See the help for the ';record' command for more information about
         recordings.

   User commands:
