egr / editgrid                Opens an 'edit' window for a workspace grid

   Format:
      ;egr <number>           Edits workspace grid <number>

   Notes:
      The workspace grid is an invisible grid, spanning the whole available
         workspace, on which Axmud tries to arrange its windows so that they
         don't overlap (as far as possible). The grid is divided into zones
         within which one or more windows are arranged. The 'blueprint' for
         zones on a desktop is called a 'zonemap'.
      Only 'grid' windows (including the 'main' window, task windows and the
         automapper window) are arranged on the workspace grid. Temporary
         windows, including the data viewer window and all edit, preference,
         wizard and dialogue windows, are not affected.

      For a list of workspace grid <number>s, use the ';listworkspace' command.

   User commands:
      egr / editgrid
