smo / setcustommonth          Sets customised months of the year

   Format:
      ;smo                    Shows current list of customised months
      ;smo <months>           Sets a new list
      ;smo -r                 Resets the list

   Notes:
      Axmud doesn't offer a generalised locale setting (converting everything
         into your preferred language), but you can at least change the months
         of the year used in logfiles with this command.
      If you specify <months>, you must specify exactly twelve words containing
         A-Z, a-z, 0-9 or underlines (first character must be a letter; maximum
         16 characters for each word). Non-Latin alphabets are acceptable.
      Also see the help for ';setcustomweek'.
