iro / ignoreroomcommand       Marks a room command as ignorable

   Format:
      ;iro <cmd>              Ignores the room <cmd>
 
   Notes:
      A few worlds (for example EmpireMUD) offer a series of commands in each
         room, which are specific to that room. The client command
         ';roomcommand' executes them in a continuous cycle, one at a time.
      This command marks a room command as ignorable, so that it's not
         executed by ';roomcommand'. It's not necessary for <cmd> to exist in
         the current room, or even in the world.
      To start using the <cmd> again, see the help for ';noticeroomcommand'.
