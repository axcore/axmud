frt / findreset               Resets the last find operation

   Format:
      ;frt                    Resets find operations in the default textview
      ;frt <number>           Resets find operations in textview <number>

   Notes:
      The ';findtext' searches a textview. If any matching text is found, Axmud
         remembers the position, so you can use the command again and again
         until you find the right line.
      This command forgets the position, so that the next search begins from the
         bottom of the textview.
      By default, the current session's default textview (where text received
         from the world is displayed) is searched, but you can specify any
         textview used by any session.

   User commands:
