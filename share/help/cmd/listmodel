lmd / listmodel               Lists world model objects

   Format:
      ;lmd     Shows the current state of the world model
      ;lmd <number>
               Shows the model object <number>
      ;lmd <start> <stop>
               Lists model objects numbered <start> to <stop>

      ;lmd <type>
               Lists all model objects of <type>
      ;lmd <type> <start> <stop>
               Lists <type> model objects numbered <start> to <stop>

   Notes:
      The world model stores information about the regions, rooms, characters
         and objects in the game world. The automapper window uses the model to
         display its maps.
      This command lists information about the state of the world model, or else
         displays a summary for a selection of model objects (use ';dumpmodel'
         to display a list of all world model objects).

      If <number> doesn't exist in the world model, an error is displayed; but
         if either <start> or <stop> (or both) don't exist, all objects with
         numbers between them will be displayed.
      <type> must be one of the following switches:
         -n region, -r room, -w weapon, -a armour, -g garment, -c character,
         -m minion, -s sentient, -k creature, -p portable, -d decoration,
         -u custom
      <type> can appear anywhere in the argument list, so ';lmd -r 1 10' and
         ';lmd 1 10 -r' are both acceptable.
      Multiple <type>s are permitted, e.g. ';lmo -r -w -a' will show all rooms,
         weapons and armours, whereas ';lmo -r -w -a 1 100' will show all rooms,
         weapons and armours numbered between #1 and #100
      This command doesn't list exits (which are in the exit model).

   User commands:
