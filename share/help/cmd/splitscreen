sps / splitscreen             Toggles split screen mode in the 'main' window

   Format:
      ;sps                    Toggles split screen mode

   Notes:
      In split screen mode the 'main' window is split into two. When text is
         received from the world (or when a system message is displayed), only
         the lower section scrolls to the bottom.
      If you're trying to read a help file, it might be convenient to turn on
         split screen mode for a while, so that you can keep an eye on what is
         happening in the world without losing your place.

      The 'main' window typically includes some buttons next to the command
         entry box. The empty window button toggles split screen mode. If the
         window has multiple panes, the 'switch active pane' button next can
         switch between them; split screen mode is then toggled on the active
         pane.
      See also the help for the ';scrolllock' command.
