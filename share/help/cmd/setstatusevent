sse / setstatusevent          Handles settings for Status task events
 
   Format:
      ;sse                    Shows current settings for Status task events
      ;sse <switches>         Modifies settings for Status task events
      
   Notes:
      A Status task event occurs when the Status task notices that your
         character has fallen asleep, passed or died. 
      If writing to the logfiles 'sleep', 'passout' and 'dead' is enabled then
         the event is recorded in those logfiles. Typically, Axmud writes some
         lines from before the event and some lines from after it.
      This command sets how many lines can be written to the logfile during each
         event.
      <switches>, if specified, can be either or both of the following switch
         options (in any order):
         
         -n <number>   - Write <number> lines from before the event
         -a <after>    - Write <number> lines from after the event
         
      <number> must be an integer, zero or above. If it's zero, then lines from
         before (or after) the event are not written at all.
