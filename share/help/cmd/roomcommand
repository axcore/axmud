room / roomcommand            Executes a room command

   Format:
      ;room                   Executes the next room command

   Notes:
      A few worlds (for example EmpireMUD) offer a series of commands in each
         room, which are specific to that room.
      This command executes those room commands in a continuous cycle, one at a
         time, but ignoring any room commands which have been marked as
         ignorable.
      The list of room commands is updated whenever the Locator task updates its
         location (after a movement command, or a 'look', or when the task is
         reset).

      See also the help for ';ignoreroomcommand', ';noticeroomcommand' and
         ';listroomcommand'.

   User commands:
      room / roomcmd / roomcommand
