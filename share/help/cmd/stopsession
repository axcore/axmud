ssn / stopsession             Stops a session and closes its tab
 
   Format:
      ;ssn                    Stops the session that processes this command
      ;ssn <number>           Stops session <number>
 
   Notes:
      Use this command to stop the session. If there are any unsaved files, 
         you'll be asked whether you want to save them first.
      This command is most useful for closing a session tab after disconnecting
         from a world. (You can also close the tab by clicking on its 'x' icon
         just underneath the 'main' window's menu.)
      For a list of session numbers, use the ';listsession' command.
