ssn / stopsession             Stops a session and closes its tab

   Format:
      ;ssn                    Stops the session that processes this command
      ;ssn <number>           Stops session <number>

      ;ssn -s                 Saves files, then stops the session
      ;ssn -s <number>        Saves files, then stops session <number>
      ;ssn <number> -s

   Notes:
      Use this command to stop the session. If there are any unsaved files,
         you'll be asked whether you want to save them first (unless
         you specified the -s switch).
      This command is most useful for closing a session tab after disconnecting
         from a world. (You can also close the tab by clicking on its 'x' icon
         just underneath the 'main' window's menu.)
      For a list of session numbers, use the ';listsession' command.

   User commands:
