dcf / deleteconfig            Deletes a text-to-speech configuration
 
   Format:
      ;dcf <name>             Deletes the configuration <name>
 
   Notes:
      If you have one or more of the text-to-speech engines installed on your
         system, Axmud can use them to convert text to speech.
      The engines currently supported on MS Windows are eSpeak, espeak-ng,
         Festival and Swift. The engines supported on Linux are eSpeak,
         espeak-ng, Flite, Festival and Swift.
      Axmud also uses a dummy engine, called 'none'. If Axmud tries to convert
         text to speech using the dummy engine, you'll hear nothing.
         
      Axmud stores a number of TTS configurations. Each configuration stores an 
         engine, voice, speed and pitch setting, among others. Text received 
         from the world uses one configuration, system messages use another, so 
         it's easy to customise the configurations so that they read aloud in 
         different voices.
      This command deletes an existing configuration. Note that some 
         configurations, namely 'espeak', 'esng', 'flite', 'festival', 'swift',
         'none', 'task', 'script' and 'default', are essential and cannot be
         deleted.
