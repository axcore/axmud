aiw / addinitialworkspace     Adds an initial workspace

   Format:
      ;aiw                    Adds an initial workspace
      ;aiw <zonemap>          Adds an initial workspace using <zonemap>

   Notes:
      Axmud supports multiple desktops or 'workspaces'. Workspaces can be both
         real and virtual. If you have multiple physical monitors, each one is a
         workspace. If your computer has a workspace switcher, allowing you to
         switch between virtual desktops, each one is a workspace.
      The workspace in which Axmud starts is its 'default workspace'. This
         command adds an additional workspace to the list of workspaces Axmud
         uses when it starts.
      If you specify a <zonemap>, that zonemap is used as the default zonemap
         for the workspace. If not, Axmud selects a default zonemap.
      The direction in which Axmud uses workspaces (left-to-right, or vice-
         versa) can be changed with the ';setworkspacedirection' command.
      See also the help for ';modifyinitialworkspace', ';deleteinitialworkspace'
         and ';listinitialworkspace'.
