alt / alert                   Tells a task to automatically read aloud alerts
 
   Format:
      ;alt <attribute>
      ;alt <attribute> <value>
                              Tells a task to read aloud an alert

      ;alt                    Get a list of available <attribute>s
 
   Notes:
      Tasks have various text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities, but some tasks don't
         use TTS at all. The ';read', ';switch' and ';alert' commands allow you 
         to interact with the TTS capabilities of individual tasks. 
      To modify the way that tasks process speech in general, use the ';speech'
         and ';editconfig' commands. TTS for tasks is turned off, by default, so
         you won't hear anything until you turn it on with the ';speech' 
         command.

      This command is used to tell the task to read something aloud 
         automatically, when some piece of data reaches a certain value; for
         example, it can be used to tell the Status task to read aloud an alert
         when your current character's health falls below a certain value, and
         then again when it recovers to a certain value.
      <attribute> specifies what you would like the task to read. Some 
         <attribute>s have a <value>. For example, you can use the 'health down'
         attribute with a <value> of 20, to tell the Status task to read aloud
         an alert when your character's health points fall to 20%.
      <attributes> consist of one or more words. Actually, they are stored as a
         single word, so the attribute 'health down' can be typed as 
         'healthdown', if you prefer.
      If you don't specify an <attribute> at all, a list of available attributes
         will be displayed.
      In many cases, a task will store the <value> you specify, for example so
         that an alert can be read aloud every time your character's health
         points fall to 20% (you can use the ';permalert' command to store the 
         <value> in tasks which start automatically at the beginning of a 
         session). All of Axmud's built-in tasks behave in this way. 
      A task must be running before you can use this command to tell it to read
         something aloud.

      This is a list of all the <attribute>s used by this command with Axmud's 
         built-in tasks. (The ';read' and ';switch' commands use different
         attributes.)

      (Status task)
         ;alert health down <percent>
            Reads an alert when your character's health points fall to <percent>
               points of the maximum. Note that world profiles are free to store
               anything in variables like these, so you might be read something
               different altogether
         ;alert health down 
            Reads an alert when your character's health points fall to 20% of 
               the maximum
         ;alert health up <percent>
            Reads an alert when your character's health points recover to
               <percent> points of the maximum
         ;alert health up 
            Reads an alert when your character's health points recover to 90% of 
               the maximum

         ;alert energy down <percent>
         ;alert energy down 
         ;alert energy up <percent>
         ;alert energy up <percent>
            Reads an alert when your character's health points fall to a minimum
               or recover to a maximum

         ;alert magic down <percent>
         ;alert magic down 
         ;alert magic up <percent>
         ;alert magic up <percent>
            Reads an alert when your character's magic points fall to a minimum
               or recover to a maximum

         ;alert guild down <percent>
         ;alert guild down 
         ;alert guild up <percent>
         ;alert guild up <percent>
            Reads an alert when your character's guild points fall to a minimum
               or recover to a maximum

         ;alert social down <percent>
         ;alert social down 
         ;alert social up <percent>
         ;alert social up <percent>
            Reads an alert when your character's social points fall to a minimum
               or recover to a maximum
