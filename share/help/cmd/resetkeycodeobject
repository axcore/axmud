rko / resetkeycodeobject      Resets a keycode object
 
   Format:
      ;rko <name>             Resets the keycode object <name>
 
   Notes:
      Keycodes are used by the system to recognise the keys on your keyboard.
         For example, the F5 key usually has the keycode 'F5', and the two SHIFT 
         keys often have the keycodes 'Shift_L' and 'Shift_R'.
      Keycodes vary between systems, so Axmud offers a set of standard keycodes
         (for example 'f5' and 'shift'). Axmud represents two keys pressed down
         together as a keycode string like 'shift f5' or 'ctrl c'. 
      Axmud's standard keycodes are mostly used with macros; they allow you to 
         design macros that will work on all systems, not just the one you're 
         using right now.

      Keycodes (and keycode strings) are stored in a keycode object. You might
         have one called 'linux' and another one called 'windows', one of which
         would be set as the 'current' keycode object. 
      This command resets a keycode object, restoring all its keycodes to their
         default values (which are those used on a Linux Mint installation).
 
   User commands:
