sas / setautosecondary        Sets preferred way to draw secondary directions
 
   Format:
      ;sas <custom> <standard>
                              Tend to draw <custom> direction as <standard>
                              
   Notes:
      Axmud provides eighteen 'standard' primary directions - the sixteen
         compass directions (including 'north', 'northeast' and
         'northnortheast') as well as 'up' and 'down'. This standard set never
         changes.
      Axmud dictionaries store a custom set of primary directions, one for each
         standard direction. Dictionaries also store a set of secondary
         directions such as 'out' and 'in', this set can contain as many or as
         few directions as you want.
      For a list of primary and secondary directions stored in the current
         dictionary, use the 'listdirection' command.               

      When the automapper creates a room with a secondary direction like 'out'
         or 'in', normally you have to tell it which direction it should be
         drawn on the map.
      If you'd prefer the automapper to draw all 'out' exits in one direction
         and all 'in' exits in another direction, you can use this command.

      <custom> must be a custom secondary direction and <standard> must be one
         of the standard primary directions listed above. Here's an example.

         ;sas out north
         ;sas in south
