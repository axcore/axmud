rfc / retainfilecopy          Retains copy of old files in file-save operations

   Format:
      ;rfc on                 Turns copy retention on
      ;rfc off                Turns copy retention off

   Notes:
      Whenever Axmud saves a config file or a data file, it first creates a
         temporary copy of the existing file (if there is one). If something
         goes wrong with the save operation, the original file is restored from
         the copy.
      When copy retention turned off, the old file is deleted as soon as the
         save operation is complete. When it is turned on, the old file is
         retained as a copy until the next save operation.
      Copy retention is turned on by default. Because Axmud is still in the
         beta-testing phase, it is recommended that you leave it on. If your
         saved data becomes corrupted and Axmud refuses to load a particular
         file, you may be able to manually restore the previous copy of the
         corrupted file.
      Relying on this functionality is not a good idea. You should still create
         your own backup copy of the whole Axmud data directory (folder) on a
         regular basis by using client commands like ';backupdata' and/or
         ';autobackup'.
