ews / editworkspace           Opens an 'edit' window for a workspace object
 
   Format:
      ;ews <number>           Edits workspace object <number>

   Notes:
      Axmud supports multiple desktops or 'workspaces'. Workspaces can be both
         real and virtual. If you have multiple physical monitors, each one is a
         workspace. If your computer has a workspace switcher, allowing you to 
         switch between virtual desktops, each one is a workspace too.
      For a list of workspace object numbers, use the ';listworkspace' command.
 
   User commands:
      ews / editws / editworkspace
