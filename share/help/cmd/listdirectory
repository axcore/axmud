ldr / listdirectory           Lists Axbasic script directories
 
   Format:
      ;ldr                    Lists script directories
 
   Notes:
      When Axmud wants to load an Axbasic script, it checks a list of 
         directories (called 'folders' on MS Windows systems), one at a time, 
         until it finds a script with the right name.
      The first directory in the list is always the standard 'scripts'
         sub-directory, but the rest of the list is customisable. This command
         displays the directories currently in the list.

   User commands:
      ldr / listdir / listfolder / listdirectory
