nro / noticeroomcommand       Marks a room command as usable

   Format:
      ;nro <cmd>              Stops ignoring the room <cmd>
 
   Notes:
      A few worlds (for example EmpireMUD) offer a series of commands in each
         room, which are specific to that room. The client command
         ';roomcommand' executes them in a continuous cycle, one at a time.
      ';ignoreroomcommand' marks a room command as ignorable, so that it's not
         executed by ';roomcommand'. This command marks the room room command
         <cmd> as usable again.
 
   User commands:
      nro / noticeroom / noticeroomcmd / noticeroomcommand
