mn / mission                  Continues the current mission

   Format:
      ;mn                     Continues the mission

   Notes:
      Continues the current mission until a break is reached or the mission is
         completed. This command can be used when the mission is on a trigger,
         pause or Locator break, not just when it's on an ordinary break.
      The ';nudgemission' command can be used to perform the next command in the
         mission (and only that command).
      See the help for ';startmission' for more information about missions.
