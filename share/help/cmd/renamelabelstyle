rls / renamelabelstyle        Renames a map label style
 
   Format:
      ;rls <old> <new>        Renames the style <old> as <new>
      
   Notes:
      Map labels are drawn in the automapper window. It's possible to customise
         labels individually, but most labels are drawn using a map label style
         (so that when the style is changed, all labels using that style are
         redrawn automatically).
      The default label styles are called 'Style 1', 'Style 2' and so on, You
         can use this command if you'd prefer to call them something like 'Map
         titles', 'Street names' and so on.
      <old> is the name of an existing map label style (use ';listlabelstyle' to
         get a list of them).
      <new> is the style's new name. <name> can be any text (maximum 16
         characters).
      If either <old> or <new> contain spaces, you should enclose the name in
         diamond brackets <...>.
