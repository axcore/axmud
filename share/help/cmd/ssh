ssh / ssh                     Connects to an unnamed world via SSH
 
   Format:
      ;ssh <host> <port>      Connects to the world
      ;ssh <host>             Connects to the world using the generic port

   Notes:
      Axmud offers three types of connection to a world - ordinary telnet, SSH 
         (Secure Shell) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). 
      This command first creates a temporary world profile - which isn't saved,
         even if you use the ';save -f' command - and then connects to the 
         specified world using the SSH protocol. The connection opens in a new 
         'main' window (or in a new tab in a shared 'main' window).
      A dialogue window will appear, asking you to enter the SSH username /
         password (note that these are often not the same as a character name
         and password). If you don't enter both of them, the session will revert 
         to using a traditional telnet connection.
      Most worlds won't accept connections using SSH, and some of those that do
         won't accept them from ordinary players. For those worlds, see the help
         for ';telnet' and ';ssl'.

   User commands:
      ssh
