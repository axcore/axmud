acs / addcolourscheme         Adds a colour scheme
 
   Format:
      ;acs <name>             Adds a colour scheme with default colours/font
      ;acs <name> <switches>  Adds a colour scheme with specified colours/font
 
   Notes:
      A textview is a scrolling area of a window where text is displayed. A
         colour scheme determines the colours and font used in the textview.
      Axmud provides a standard set of colour schemes, one for each window type.
         These colour schemes can be modified (with ';modifycolourscheme'), but 
         not deleted (with ';deletecolourscheme').
      You can also create your own colour schemes using this command. The colour
         schemes used in windows normally depends on the winmap, so you should 
         see the help for ';addwinmap' too.
  
      The colour scheme's <name> must be no longer than 16 characters, contain
         only A-Z, a-z, underlines and 0-9 (not the first character) and not be
         one of Axmud's reserved names (see the ';listreserved' command).
         Non-Latin alphabets are acceptable.
      <switches> are optional, and can be any of the following switch options, 
         in any order:

         -t <text>        - Sets the text colour, must be an Axmud colour tag
         -u <underlay>    - Sets the underlay colour, must be an Axmud underlay
                               colour tag
         -b <background>  - Sets the background colour, must be an Axmud colour
                               tag
         -f <font>        - Sets the font
         -s <size>        - Sets the font size, must be a positive integer

      If colours/fonts are not specified, then default colours/fonts are used.

      If you add a colour scheme with the same name as a task, the colour scheme
         is applied to the task automatically whenever it starts. For example,
         if you want to apply a colour scheme to every Divert task you start,
         name the scheme 'divert' (or use the task's internal name,
         'divert_task'. Note that the <name> must be all lower-case letters, and
         abbreviations such as 'div' won't work.)
      The <underlay> colour, if specified, is ignored by task windows which
         operate in so-called monochrome mode, such as the Status and Divert
         tasks (but not the Locator task.)
