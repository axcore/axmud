acs / addcolourscheme         Adds a colour scheme
 
   Format:
      ;acs <name>             Adds a colour scheme with default colours/font
      ;acs <name> <switches>  Adds a colour scheme with specified colours/font
 
   Notes:
      A textview is a scrolling area of a window where text is displayed. A
         colour scheme determines the colours and font used in the textview.
      Axmud provides a standard set of colour schemes, one for each window type.
         These colour schemes can be modified (with ';modifycolourscheme'), but 
         not deleted (with ';deletecolourscheme').
      You can also create your own colour schemes using this command. The colour
         schemes used in windows normally depends on the winmap, so you should 
         see the help for ';addwinmap' too.
  
      Colour scheme must be no longer than 16 characters, contain only A-Z, a-z, 
         underlines and 0-9 (not the first character) and not be one of Axmud's 
         reserved names (see the ';listreserved' command).
      <switches> are optional, and can be any of the following switch options, 
         in any order:

         -t <text>        - Sets the text colour, must be an Axmud colour tag
         -u <underlay>    - Sets the underlay colour, must be an Axmud underlay
                               colour tag
         -b <background>  - Sets the background colour, must be an Axmud colour
                               tag
         -f <font>        - Sets the font
         -s <size>        - Sets the font size, must be a positive integer

      If colours/fonts are not specified, then default colours/fonts are used.
