   Notes:
      Some MUDs use protocols to exchange (negotiate) information which the 
         client that can be used to improve the gaming experience. Axmud 
         supports several protocols, including MSDP (Mud Server Data Protocol).
      MSDP sends extra information about the character, such as their current 
         health (hit) points. Some of this information is used to update the 
         Status task (and, from there, the current character profile). 
         Information about the character's current location, if sent, is used to
         update the Locator task. The information is available to your scripts,
         if they want it, and can be viewed with this command.
