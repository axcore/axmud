telnet / telnet               Connects to an unnamed world via telnet

   Format:
      ;telnet <host> <port>   Connects to the world
      ;telnet <host>          Connects to the world using the generic port

   Notes:
      Axmud offers three types of connection to a world - ordinary telnet, SSH
         (Secure Shell) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).
      This command first creates a temporary world profile - which isn't saved,
         even if you use the ';save -f' command - and then connects to the
         specified world using the telnet protocol. The connection opens in a
         new 'main' window (or in a new tab in a shared 'main' window).
      See also the help for the ';ssh' and ';ssl' commands.

   User commands:
      telnet
