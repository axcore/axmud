hrp / haltreplay              Halts a buffer replay currently in progress

   Format:
      ;hrp                    Halts the current replay

   Notes:
      The display buffer is Axmud's record of text received from the world and
         displayed in its default tab. The world command buffer is Axmud's
         record of individual commands sent to the world. (See the help for
         ';displaybuffer' and ';commandbuffer').
      This command halts any replay in progress (see the help for
         ';replaybuffer').
