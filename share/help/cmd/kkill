kk / kkill                    Attacks all matching target(s) in the current room
 
   Format:
      ;kk                     Attacks the first NPC in the room
      ;kk <word>              Attack all targets matching <word>
      ;kk <word_list>         Attacks all targets matching <word_list>
 
   Notes:
      ';kkill' works in exactly the same way as ';kill', but with one important
         difference: whereas ';kill' only matches a single target for each 
         argument, ';kkill' matches all possible targets for each argument.
      So, ';kkill guard' will attack every guard in the room, and
         ';kill hairy orc' will attack every orc, and every being described as
         'hairy'.
      See also the help for ';kill'.
