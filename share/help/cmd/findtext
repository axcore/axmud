find / findtext               Finds matching text in a textview

   Format:
      ;find <switches> <pattern>
      ;find <pattern> <switches>
                              Finds matching text

   Notes:
      This command finds text matching the pattern/regular expression <pattern>.
         By default, the current session's default textview (where text received
         from the world is displayed) is searched, but you can specify any
         textview used by any session.
      <switches>, if specified, can be one or more of the following switch
         patterns, in any order:

            -t <number> - Finds text in textview object <number>
            -p          - Finds the previous match (the default behaviour)
            -n          - Finds the next match (can't be combined with '-p')
            -c          - Performs a case-sensitive search
            -s          - Splits the textview into two on a successful match

      Axmud remembers the position of the last successful match, so you can
         use this command again and again until you find the right line.
      To make Axmud forget this position - so that the next search will start
         from the bottom of the textview - use the ';findreset' command.
