call / chatcall               Calls one of your contacts
 
   Format:
      ;call <name>            Calls <name>
 
   Notes:
      The Chat task is used to chat with other players directly via telnet.
         Calls can be placed (or accepted) with any user whose MUD client uses
         the zChat or MudMaster protocols.
      This command opens a chat session with someone in your contacts list
         called <name>, creating a new Chat task, if necessary.
      You can add people to your contacts list with the ';addcontact' command.
      To call someone who's not on your contacts list, use the ';chatmcall' and
         ';chatzcall' commands.
