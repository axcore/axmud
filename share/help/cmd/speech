tts / speech                  Modifies text-to-speech (TTS) general settings

   Format:
      ;speech                 Shows current text-to-speech settings
      ;speech <options>       Modifies text-to-speech settings

   Notes:
      If you have one or more of the text-to-speech engines installed on your
         system, Axmud can use them to convert text to speech.
      The engines currently supported on MS Windows are eSpeak, espeak-ng,
         Festival and Swift. The engines supported on Linux are eSpeak,
         espeak-ng, Flite, Festival and Swift.
      Axmud also uses a dummy engine, called 'none'. If Axmud tries to convert
         text to speech using the dummy engine, you'll hear nothing.

      This command can be used to modify general text-to-speech settings.
         (Individual text-to-speech configurations can be modified with the
         ';editconfig' command.)

      If specified, <options> should be one of the following:

         ;speech on           Enables text-to-speech for all users
         ;speech off          Disables text-to-speech for all users (however,
                                 the ';speak' command will still work)
         ;speech toggle       Enables or disables text-to-speech

      (Note that text-to-speech is always active when running the version of
         Axmud that's optimised for visually-impaired users. You can still
         enable/disable text-to-speech for all users, and that setting will be
         applied to all versions of Axmud.)

      If specified, <options> could also be one of the following:

         ;speech verbose on
         ;speech verbose off  Turns on/off verbose output. When on, output is
                                 preceded by 'System message', 'Received text'
                                 and so on
         ;speech receive on
         ;speech receive off  Turns conversion of received text to speech on/off
         ;speech login on
         ;speech login off    Turns on/off login protection. When on, received
                                 text isn't converted to speech before the
                                 automatic login is processed, unless it's a
                                 prompt
         ;speech prompt on    Turns on/off conversion of prompts after the
         ;speech prompt off      login. Only recognised prompts are affected, so
                                 this command is especially useful with pre-
                                 configured worlds
         ;speech system on
         ;speech system off   Turns conversion of system messages to speech
                                 on/off
         ;speech error on
         ;speech error off    Turns conversion of system error messages on/off.
                                 Also affects system warnings and system debug
                                 messages
         ;speech command on
         ;speech command off  Turns conversion of world commands on/off
         ;speech dialogue on
         ;speech dialogue off Turns conversion of (most) dialogue windows on/off
         ;speech task on
         ;speech task off     Turns on/off the ability of some tasks (such as
                                 the Status and Divert tasks) to convert certain
                                 items of text to speech

         ;speech smooth on
         ;speech smooth off   Turns on/off TTS smoothing, which tries to read
                                 sentences split over several lines more
                                 smoothly (the 'on' setting is recommended)

         ;speech port <port>  Sets the port used by the Festival server engine
         ;speech port default Resets the port used by the Festival server engine
                                 to the default 1314
         ;speech port none    Disables use of the Festival (Axmud will use the
                                 command-line engine instead)

      Normal Axmud switches can be used, if you prefer: -o for on, -f for off,
         -g for toggle, -v for verbose, -r for receive, -l for login,
         -s for system, -e for error, -c for command, -d for dialogue,
         -t for task, -m for smooth and -p for port.
