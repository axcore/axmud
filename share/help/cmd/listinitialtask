lit / listinitialtask         Lists initial tasks

   Format:
      ;lit
               Lists the global initial tasklist
      ;lit <profile>
               Lists the <profile>'s initial tasklist
      ;lit -c
               Lists everything in all current profiles' initial tasklists
      ;lit -a
               Lists everything in all profiles' initial tasklists

   Notes:
      Initial tasks are started when Axmud marks the current character as logged
         in (you can use the ';login' command to override the automatic process,
         if necessary), or when the user changes a current profile with
         commands like ';setworld' and ';setchar'.
      See the help for ';addinitialtask' for more information about initial
         tasks.

   User commands:
      lit / listinittask / listinitialtask
