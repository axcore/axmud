move / movedirection          Sends a movement command to the world

   Format:
      ;move <direction>       Move the character in <direction>

   Notes:
      Some world commands should cause the world to send a room statement in
         response. (A room statement is the complete room description, including
         any exits and the room's contents.)
      This generally includes the commands for 'look', 'glance', 'go', 'sail',
         'fly' (and so on). Axmud stores world commands that have been sent, and
         marks any that it thinks will cause a room statement to be received.
      When the Locator task is running, it works out how many room statements to
         expect by counting how many of these commands have been sent.

      In some situations - for example, when moving in unusual directions such
         as 'enter basket' - it might be desirable to inform Axmud that this is
         definitely a movement command. You can use ';movedirection' to do this.
      ';relaydirection' can be used to send a non-movement command.

   User commands:
      move / movedir / movedirection
