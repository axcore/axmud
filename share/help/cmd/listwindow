lwn / listwindow              Lists 'grid' windows
 
   Format:
      ;lwn                    Lists all 'grid' windows
      ;lwn <switch>           Lists windows, showing specified information

      ;lwn -s                 Lists this session's 'grid' windows
      ;lwn -s <switch>        Lists windows, showing specified information
      ;lwn <switch> -s
 
   Notes:
      The workspace grid is an invisible grid, spanning the whole available
         workspace, on which Axmud tries to arrange its windows so that they 
         don't overlap (as far as possible). The grid is divided into zones 
         within which one or more windows are arranged. The 'blueprint' for 
         zones on a desktop is called a 'zonemap'. 
      Only 'grid' windows (including the 'main' window, task windows and the 
         automapper window) are arranged on the workspace grid. Temporary
         windows, including the object viewer window and all edit, preference,
         wizard and dialogue windows, are not affected.

      This command lists all 'grid' windows across all sessions or (if -s is
         specified) for this session only. (Use the ';listfreewindow' command to
         list 'free' windows.)
      <switch> specifies which size and position information is shown:
         -w   Show window size and position on the workspace (same as ';lwn')
         -g   Show window size and position on its workspace grid
         -z   Show window size and position on its zone's internal grid
      If the window is in a workspace without a workspace grid, <switch> shows
         no additional information.
 
   User commands:
      lwn / listwin / listwindow
