lka / listkeycodealternative  Lists alternative forms for keycodes

   Format:
      ;lka                    Lists alternate standard keycodes

   Notes:
      Keycodes are used by the system to recognise the keys on your keyboard.
         For example, the F5 key usually has the keycode 'F5', and the two SHIFT
         keys often have the keycodes 'Shift_L' and 'Shift_R'.
      Keycodes vary between systems, so Axmud offers a set of standard keycodes
         (for example 'f5' and 'shift'). Axmud represents two keys pressed down
         together as a keycode string like 'shift f5' or 'ctrl c'.
      Axmud's standard keycodes are mostly used with macros; they allow you to
         design macros that will work on all systems, not just the one you're
         using right now.

      Some Axmud standard keycodes have alternative names that you can use
         freely in your macros (and with this command); for example, 'page_up'
         can also be called 'pageup'.
      A few American English forms are also recognised; for example, 'full_stop'
         and 'period' are equivalent.
      Use this command to display a complete list of alternative forms for
         Axmud's standard keycodes.
