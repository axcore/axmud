dit / deleteinitialtask       Deletes a task from an initial tasklist
 
   Format:
      ;dit <task>
               Deletes the <task> from the global initial tasklist
      ;dit -a
               Deletes everything in the global initial tasklist
      ;dit <task> <profile>
               Deletes the <task> from the <profile>'s initial tasklist
      ;dit -a <profile>
               Deletes everything in the <profile>'s initial tasklist
 
   Notes:
      Initial tasks are started when Axmud marks the current character as logged 
         in (you can use the ';login' command to override the automatic process, 
         if necessary), or when the user changes a current profile with commands 
         like ';setworld' and ';setchar'.
      See the help for ';addinitialtask' for more information about initial 
         tasks.

      <task> is the initial task's unique name e.g. 'status_task_16' (use
         ;listinitialtask to list initial task names).
 
   User commands:
      dit / delinittask / deleteinittask / deleteinitialtask
