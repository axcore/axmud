lls / listlabelstyle          Lists map label styles

   Format:
      ;lls <name>             Lists styles

   Notes:
      Map labels are drawn in the automapper window. It's possible to customise
         labels individually, but most labels are drawn using a map label style
         (so that when the style is changed, all labels using that style are
         redrawn automatically).
      This command displays a list of map label styles and their attributes.

   User commands:
      lls / liststyle / listlabelstyle
