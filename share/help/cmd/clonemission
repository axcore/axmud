cmn / clonemission            Clones an existing mission
 
   Format:
      ;cmn <original> <copy>
               Clones the <original> mission into one named <copy>
 
   Notes:
      New missions can be created by using recordings. See the help for the
         ';record' command for information about making recordings.
      This command clones a new mission using the contents of an existing one.
      Missions are stored in the current world profile. Mission names must be no
         longer than 16 characters, contain only A-Z, a-z, underlines and 0-9 
         (not the first character) and not be one of Axmud's reserved names (see 
         the ';listreserved' command).
      See the help for ';startmission' for more information about missions.
