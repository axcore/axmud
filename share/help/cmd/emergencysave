ems / emergencysave           Performs an emergency save
 
   Format:
      ;ems                    Performs an emergency save
 
   Notes:
      If a normal save operation fails, Axmud usually disables file access, but
         allows you to perform an 'emergency save'.
      During an emergency save, all data in memory is save to a temporary 
         directory (folder) that you specify. You should NOT specify Axmud's 
         normal data directory.
      If even the emergency save fails, you can use this command to try again.
         A USB drive would be an ideal location to save files, as it hopefully
         won't be affected by any problems that your hard drive is experiencing.
      If the emergency save succeeds, you should shut down Axmud. Having made a
         backup copy of the normal Axmud data directory, you can then 
         copy-and-paste any files that you want to keep from the emergency 
         directory into the normal Axmud data directory.

      This command works even when normal file access has been disabled by the 
         ;disablesaveload or ;disablesaveworld commands.
