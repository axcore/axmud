ccf / cloneconfig             Clones an existing text-to-speech configuration
 
   Format:
      ;ccf <original> <clone>
               Clones the configuration <original> into one called <copy>
 
   Notes:
      If you have one or more of the text-to-speech engines installed on your
         system, Axmud can use them to convert text to speech.
      The engines currently supported on MS Windows are eSpeak, espeak-ng and
         Swift. The engines supported on Linux are eSpeak, espeak-ng, Flite,
         Festival and Swift.
      Axmud also uses a dummy engine, called 'none'. If Axmud tries to convert
         text to speech using the dummy engine, you'll hear nothing.
         
      Axmud stores a number of TTS configurations. Each configuration stores an 
         engine, voice, speed and pitch setting, among others. Text received 
         from the world uses one configuration, system messages use another, so 
         it's easy to customise the configurations so that they read aloud in 
         different voices.
      You can use this command to create a new configuration, using the same 
         engine, voice, word speed and word pitch as an existing configuration. 
         The original configuration's exclusive and excluded patterns are also 
         cloned, if set.
