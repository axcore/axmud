ady / adddictionary           Adds a new dictionary
 
   Format:
      ;ady <name>
               Adds a new dictionary called <name>
      ;ady <name> <language>
               Adds a new dictionary <name> using <language>
 
   Notes:
      Dictionaries help Axmud to interpret the text it receives from the world.
      An Axmud dictionary stores groups of words. It contains a group of weapon
         words ('sword', 'mace', etc), a group of words for living beings
         ('orc', 'dwarf', etc), and several more besides.
      It also contains several useful terms, such as phrases for times of the
         day.

      This command creates a new dictionary which is available for any world
         profile to use (see the help for ';setdictionary').
      The operation will fail if a dictionary called <name> already exists.
      If <language> isn't specified, the dictionary's language is marked as
         'English'.
      If <language> is specified, the dictionary's default settings (which are
         all in English) don't magically translate themselves into the new
         language - it's up to the user to make the changes.

      If you want to create multiple dictionaries using another language, use
         ';adddictionary <name> <new_language>', change the default settings for
         that language, and then use ';clonedictionary' to create individual 
         dictionaries with the same language and initial settings.
      Dictionary names must be no longer than 16 characters, contain only A-Z, 
         a-z, underlines and 0-9 (not the first character) and not be one of 
         Axmud's reserved names (see the ';listreserved' command). The same
         restriction applies to the language. Non-Latin alphabets are
         acceptable.
