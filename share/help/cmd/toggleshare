tsh / toggleshare             Toggles sharing of 'main' windows on or off

   Format:
      ;tsh                    Toggles sharing of 'main' windows on or off
 
   Notes:
      When Axmud connects to multiple worlds at the same time. Each connection
         (even in 'connect offline' mode) is handled by an Axmud session. This
         command sets whether sessions should share a single 'main' window, or
         not.

      When session share a single 'main' window, each session is displayed in 
         its own tab. 
      Sessions often open additional windows. Those windows are arranged on a
         'workspace grid', which stops windows from overlapping each other (as
         (far as possible). When sessions share a single 'main' window, they 
         each have their own workspace grid that other sessions are not allowed
         to use. The session's windows are arrange on this grid, and are only 
         visible when the session's tab is the visible one.

      When sessions each have their own 'main' window, additional windows are
         placed on a single workspace grid shared between them.

      This command switches between the two state of affairs. The change is not
         applied until the next time Axmud starts.
