frk / freekeys                Toggles cursor (etc) keys for replaying TTS

   Format:
      ;frk                    Toggles cursor (etc) keys

   Notes:
      When running the version of Axmud that's optimised for visually-impaired
         users, some keys are used for replaying text that has been converted
         to speech.
      This command can be used to disable or re-enable that functionality, in
         case the user needs those keys for something else.

      They keys used (and their equivalent client commands) are:

         home         ;split
         end          ;prompt
         left         ;unskip
         right        ;skip
         up           ;first
         down         ;last
         page up      ;unskip more
         page down    ;skip more
         tab          ;resume
         escape       ;shutup

      This command only works with the optimised version. When running the
         normal version, use the ';hijackkeys' command instead.
      See also the help for ';split', ';skip', ';unskip', ';first', ';last',
         ';resume' and ';shutup'.
