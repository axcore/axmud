drt / deleteroute             Deletes a pre-defined route
 
   Format:
      ;drt <start> <stop> <switches>
               Deletes the road/quick route from <start> to <stop>
      ;drt <start> <name> <switches>
               Deletes the circuit route <name> from room <start>
 
   Notes:
      Axmud pre-defined routes are an easy way to move between rooms in the
         world (see the help for ';addroute' for information about routes).

      <switches> consist of the following switch options:

      Group 1 switch options: 0 or 1 of the following patterns must be used:
         -no pattern-         - Deletes a road route
         -o                   - Deletes a road route
         -q                   - Deletes a quick route
         -t                   - Deletes a circuit route
 
      Group 2 switch options: 0 or 1 of the following patterns must be used:
         -no pattern-         - Deletes route associated with the current world
         -w                   - Deletes route associated with the current world
         -g                   - Deletes route associated with the current guild
         -r                   - Deletes route associated with the current race
         -c                   - Deletes route associated with the current 
                                   character
         -x <category>        - Deletes route associated with the current custom
                                   profile <category>
         -d <prof>            - Deletes route associated with profile <prof>
 
     <start> and <stop> are the room tags of the initial and final rooms. For
        circuit routes, <start> is the room tag of the initial (and final) room,
        and <name> is the name of the circuit.
     <switches> may be placed anywhere in the command, in any order, but the
         order of <start> <stop> or <start> <name> must be preserved.
