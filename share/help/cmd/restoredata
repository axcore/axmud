rsd / restoredata             Restores Axmud data directory from backup

   Format:
      ;rsd                    Restores data files
      ;rsd <path>             Restores data files from backup file <path>

   Notes:
      Axmud stores all of its data files in a single directory (folder).
      This command restores data files from a backup file you made using the
         ';backupdata' or ';autobackup' commands, replacing all existing data
         files.

      If you specify the <path> to a backup file, that file is used. Otherwise
         you'll be prompted to choose a backup file.

      Actually, it's not true to say that existing data files are replaced.
         Axmud simply renames your existing data directory from something like
         'axmud-data' to something like 'axmud-data_OLD_2' (so if something
         goes wrong with the backup/restore process, you won't lose everything).
         A new data directory called 'axmud-data' is then created, and the
         backup file is used to restore data there.

      See also the help for ';setdatadirectory'.
