lsm / listsmiley              Lists smileys used by the Chat task
 
   Format:
      ;lsm                    Lists smileys
 
   Notes:
      For the benefit of Axmud users under the age of ten, the Chat task 
         automatically converts smileys such as :) and ;) into colourful icons
         (unless this behaviour has been turned off by using the 
         ';chatsetsmiley off' command).
      This command displays Axmud's current list of smileys.

   User commands:
      lsm / listsmily / listsmiley
