rrm / resetroom               Resets the automapper's current room

   Format:
      ;rrm                    Resets the current room

   Notes:
      Axmud's automapper is capable of tracking the character's current location
         even when the automapper window isn't open. It's the equivalent of
         using the automapper window in 'follow' mode - no new rooms or exits
         are added to the world model, but certain statistics, such as the
         number of visits per room, are still updated.
      This command resets the current room, which stops Axmud from tracking the
         character's location (regardless of whether the automapper window is
         open, or not). When you're ready, use the ';setroom' command to set the
         new current room.
      See also the help for ';go'.
