ht / halttask                 Halts a task (gracefully)

   Format:
      ;ht <task>              Halts <task>
      ;ht -a                  Halts all current tasks

   Notes:
      <task> can be any Axmud built-in or external task that's currently
         running.
      <task> can be in the form of a task's label (e.g. 'stat, 'status'), its
         formal name (e.g. 'status_task') or the task's unique name (e.g.
         'status_task_4').
      (Use the ';listtasklabel' command to list all task labels.)
      If there is more than one task matching <task>, they will all be halted.

      ';halttask' asks the task to shutdown gracefully. The task may comply
         immediately, or it may need to do some housekeeping first.
      Use ';killtask' to kill a task immediately or ';pausetask' to pause it.

   User commands:
