sor / setofflineroom          Sets the type of room statement in 'offline' mode
 
   Format:
      ;sor <switch>           Sets the type of room statement used
      ;sor                    Shows the type of room statement used
 
   Notes:
      When the session has been started in 'connect offline' mode, it's possible
         to set the automapper's current room and then to move around the map as
         normal. Axmud generates a room statement every time you type a 'look', 
         a 'glance' or a movement command. The text generated depends on the 
         patterns stored in the current world profile.
      This command specifies the type of room statement to generate. <switch>
         can be '-v' for verbose, '-s' for short verbose or '-b' for brief. You
         can also use the words 'verbose', 'short' and 'brief' in place of 
         <switch>.
      The commands will fail if the current world profile doesn't know how to
         recognise room statements of the specified type.
