go / go                       Moves the character to a new room
 
   Format:
      ;go <tag>               Moves to the room tagged <tag>
      ;go <number>            Moves to the room <number>
      ;go -n <number> 
 
   Notes:
      This command moves the character from one room in the world model to
         another using the shortest possible path. It's the equivalent of
         double-clicking on a room in the automapper window (or right-clicking 
         on a room, and selecting 'Go to room').

      You can specify <tag>, the room tag for the target room, or <number>, the
         target room's unique number in the world model.
      Room tags can be numerical, so if you want to go to room #100 - not the 
         room whose room tag is 100 - use the optional '-n' switch.
      This command can be used even when the automapper window isn't open. Use 
         the ';setroom' command to set your location first.
