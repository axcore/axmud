lcw / locatorwizard           Opens the Locator wizard window
 
   Format:
      ;lcw                    Starts the wizard
 
   Notes:
      The Locator wizard window configures the Locator task for the current 
         world profile and current dictionary.
      The automapper depends directly on the Locator task so, unless you are
         using a pre-configured world, each new world profile must be set up
         correctly before the automapper can be used.
 
   User commands:
      lcw / locwiz / locwizard / locatorwizard
