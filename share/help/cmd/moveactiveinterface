mai / moveactiveinterface     Moves active interfaces

   Format:
      ;mai <number> <posn>    Moves interface <number> to position <posn>

   Notes:
      Axmud interfaces are triggers, aliases, macros, timers and hooks.
      Most interfaces are associated with a particular profile and are called
         'inactive' interfaces. When the profile becomes a current profile, its
         interfaces become 'active' (except those whose name is the same as an
         existing active interface associated with a higher-priority profile).
      This command works on active interfaces, which are checked in a defined
         order. The ';listactiveinterface' command shows the order in which
         interfaces are checked.
      <number> is the active interface's unique number (for this session), and
         <posn> is a position in a list of triggers (or aliases, macros, timers
         or hooks) which are checked, in order, from beginning to end. The
         beginning of the list is position 1.
