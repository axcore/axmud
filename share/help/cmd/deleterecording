drc / deleterecording         Deletes line(s) from the current recording
 
   Format:
      ;drc <line>             Deletes line <number>
      ;drc <start> <stop>     Deletes line number <start> to line number <stop>
      ;drc                    Deletes the last line
 
   Notes:
      If you don't specify a line number, the last line in the recording is
         deleted. If you're using an insertion point (specified with the
         ';insertrecording' command), that line won't necessarily be the most 
         recently-added one.
      Starting a new recording automatically overwrites the previous one, so it
         might be easier to just use the ';record' command.
      See the help for the ';record' command for more information about
         recordings.
