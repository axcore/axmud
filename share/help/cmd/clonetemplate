ctm / clonetemplate           Clones an existing profile template
 
   Format:
      ;ctm <original> <copy>
               Clones a profile template <original> to one named <copy>
 
   Notes:
      The blueprint for a new category of profile is called a profile template. 
         Several custom profiles can be based on a single template.
      Standard profiles have the category 'world', 'guild', 'race' or 'char'.
         Custom profiles have the category of the template on which they're
         based. As soon as a template is used to create a custom profile, it is
         marked as 'fixed', meaning that no further changes can be made to its
         properties.
      However, it's possible to clone a template. The original will have the
         category <original> and the clone will have the category <copy>. The
         clone will get the same set of properties as the original has.
      The clone will not be marked as 'fixed' - regardless of whether the 
         original was marked as fixed, or not - so you can modify its properties
         (right up until the moment it is used to create its first custom 
         profile, at which point the cloned template will also be marked as 
         'fixed'.)
      Category names must be no longer than 16 characters, contain only A-Z, 
         a-z, underlines and 0-9 (not the first character) and not be one of 
         Axmud's reserved names (see the ';listreserved' command).
      (See the help for ';listprofile' for more information about profiles.)
