sgmcp / sendgmcp              Sends encoded JSON data to the world via GMCP
 
   Format:
      ;sgmcp <payload>        Sends a GMCP request to the world
 
   Notes:
      The world can use the GMCP protocol to send extra information about the 
         game state (see the help for ';gmcp'). 
      The client can also use GMCP to send information back to the world, 
         typically to request more data. A GMCP <payload> is usually in the 
         form:
            
         Package[.SubPackages].Message data

      Consult the world's own documentation for details of which GMCP requests
         it accepts.
