art / addroute                Adds a new pre-defined route
 
   Format:
      ;art <start> <stop> <route> <switches>
               Adds a road/quick <route> from <start> to <stop>
      ;art <start> <stop> -a <switches>
               Saves current recording as a road/quick route, <start> to <stop>
 
      ;art <start> <name> <route> <switches>
               Adds a circuit <route> called <name> from room <start>
      ;art <start> <name> -a <switches>
               Saves the current recording as a circuit route from <start>
 
   Notes:
      Axmud pre-defined routes are an easy way to move between rooms in the game
         world. 
      Each route consists of nothing more than a set of world commands; a simple 
         route might be 'n;n;nw;n;n;e'.
      Pre-defined routes are independent of the world model; they work even if
         you have not drawn any maps, and they are not altered if you modify any
         of your maps.

      There are three types of pre-defined route. A 'road' route represents the
         path between two rooms, using the game world's own roads and paths. A
         'quick' route represents the shortest path between two rooms. Road and
         quick routes connect two rooms called <start> and <stop>.
      The third type of pre-defined route is a 'circuit' route, which starts and 
         stops in a room called <start>. A circuit route has a <name>, so that 
         you can create more than one circuit starting in a particular room.

      <start> and <stop> refer to room tags - short descriptions of a room such 
         as 'tower', 'hall' or 'crossroads'. Ideally, the <start> and <stop> 
         room tags should match those you create in your maps, but you can use
         any set of room tags you like - the pre-defined route doesn't know
         anything about equivalent rooms in the world model. (NB Room tags have
         a maximum length of 16 characters and, for technical reasons, can't
         contain the sequence @@@)

      Pre-defined routes are stored in route cages. There is one cage for each 
         current profile, and the usual priority rules apply - a road route 
         between two rooms (associated with the current character profile) takes 
         priority over the route between the same two rooms (associated with the 
         current world profile). 
      As a result, you can create several routes between the same two rooms: one
         default route attached to a world, another route attached to a guild,
         another to a particular character. Axmud auto-magically uses the route
         belonging to the highest-priority current profile.

      <switches> consist of the following switch options:

      Group 1 switch options: 0 or 1 of the following options may be used:
         -no option-          - Creates a road route
         -o                   - Creates a road route
         -q                   - Creates a quick route
         -t                   - Creates a circuit route
 
      Group 2 switch options: 0 or 1 of the following options may be used:
         -no option-          - Associates the route with the current world
         -g                   - Associates the route with the current guild         
         -w                   - Associates the route with the current world
         -r                   - Associates the route with the current race
         -c                   - Associates the route with the current character
         -x <category>        - Associates the route with the current custom
                                   profile <category>
         -d <prof>            - Associates the route with profile <prof>

      Group 3 switch options: 0 or 1 of the following options may be used:
         -h                   - Route not hoppable (can't be combined with other
                                   routes using the ';drive' command)
 
     If you specify -a instead of <route>, a route will be created using the
        current recording, but only using world commands in that recording. (See 
        the help for ';record' for more information about recordings.)
     If <route> contains spaces, it should be enclosed in diamond brackets
        e.g. <n;nw;open door;n> 
     <switches> may be placed anywhere in the command, in any order, but the
         order of <start> <stop> <route> or <start> <name> <route> must be
         preserved.
