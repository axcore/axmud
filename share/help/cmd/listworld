lw / listworld                Lists all world profiles
 
   Format:
      ;lw                     Lists world profiles

   Notes:
      All world profiles are loaded from file and stored in memory, even those 
         which aren't being used. Guild, race and custom profiles are only 
         loaded (or created) when a session loads (or creates) their associated 
         world profile.
 
   User commands:
