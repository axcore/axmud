atp / addtaskpackage          Adds a task package name
 
   Format:
      ;atp <task_name> <package_name>
               Adds a task <package_name> for the task <task_name>
 
   Notes:
      <package_name> is the name of the Perl package that handles a task, e.g.
         'Games::Axmud::Task::Status' for the Status task.
      <task_name> matches the task's formal name, e.g. 'status_task',
         'locator_task', etc.    
      If, for any reason, you remove a task package name (probably with the
         ';deletetaskpackage' or ';resettaskpackage' commands), you can use this
         command to replace it. If a task package name already exists for this
         <task_name>, it is replaced with the new <package_name>. 
      The operation will fail if the specified task is currently running or if
         <task_name> is longer than 16 characters.
 
   User commands:
      atp / addtp / addtaskpackage
