ahp / addhashproperty         Adds a new hash property to a template

   Format:
      ;ahp <template> <property> <list>
               Gives the <template> a hash <property> set to <list>
      ;ahp <template> <property>
               Gives the <template> a list <property> set to an empty hash

   Notes:
      The blueprint for a new category of profile is called a profile template.
         Several custom profiles can be based on a single template.
      This command adds a property to the blueprint (a property can be used
         interchangeably with the terms 'instance variable' and 'IV'). When a
         new custom profile is created, the property is copied from the template
         to the profile.
      If specified, <list> should be a flat list in the form
         (key, value, key, value...)
      The operation will fail if a property named <property> already exists, or
         if <property> is one of a small number of reserved property names. It
         will also fail if <list> contains an odd number of elements or
         duplicate keys.
      (See the help for ';listprofile' for more information about profiles.)
