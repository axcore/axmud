sdm / setdebuggermode         Starts or configures the Debugger task
 
   Format:
      ;sdm                    Starts the task or displays current task modes
      ;sdm <switches>         Starts the task and/or modifies task modes
 
   Notes:
      The Debugger task diverts (or copies) system messages (error, warning, 
         debug and improper arguments messages) into a separate task window. 
      For each of the four kinds of system message, the task can operate in 
         three modes - display the message in the 'main' window only, or in the 
         task window only, or in both (the default mode). When the task isn't
         running, system messages are only displayed in the 'main' window.
      If no <switches> are specified, the current Debugger task's modes are
         listed; but if the task is not running, it is started using its default
         modes.
      If <switches> are specified, the current task's modes are modified; but if
         the task is not running, it is started using the specified modes.

      <switches> is used to specify one or more types of system message:
         -e   error messages
         -w   warning messages
         -d   debug messages
         -i   improper messages
         -a   all system messages
      <switches> must also specify exactly one mode setting:
         -m   the system message(s) are displayed in 'main' window only (what 
                 happens when the Debugger task is not running)
         -b   the system message(s) are displayed in both the 'main' and task 
                 windows (the default mode, when the Debugger task is running)
         -t   the system message(s) are displayed in the task window only
      You can specify several types of system message, but only one mode, e.g.
         ;setdebuggermode -e -w -m

   User commands:
      sdm / debugmode / setdebugmode / setdebuggermode
