fwn / fixwindow               Fixes a window at its current size/position
 
   Format:
      ;fwn <number>
               Fixes window <number> without resizing it (if possible)
      ;fwn -r <number>
      ;fwn <number> -r
               Fixes window <number> and resizes it to fit the zone
 
   Notes:
      The workspace grid is an invisible grid, spanning the whole available
         workspace, on which Axmud tries to arrange its windows so that they 
         don't overlap (as far as possible). The grid is divided into zones 
         within which one or more windows are arranged. The 'blueprint' for 
         zones on a desktop is called a 'zonemap'. 
      Only 'grid' windows (including the 'main' window, task windows and the 
         automapper window) are arranged on the workspace grid. Temporary 
         windows, including the GUI window and all edit, preference, wizard and
         dialogue windows, are not affected.

      This command can be used with any window on Axmud's workspace grids. Users 
         are free to drag 'grid' windows around the desktop, to resize them
         manually or even to move them to other workspaces. 
      Axmud will adjust the window's size and position, using the zone under the
         top-left corner of the window and moving the window into the first
         available space in that zone. If the -r switch is specified, the window 
         will be re-sized as if the window had just been created in that zone; 
         otherwise the window usually isn't resized.
      The operation will fail if the window isn't allowed in the new zone or 
         (when the -r switch isn't specified) the windows is too big for the new
         zone.
      A window's <number> can be obtained with the ';listwindow' command.
