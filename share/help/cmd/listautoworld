law / listautoworld           Shows the list of auto-connecting worlds
 
   Format:
      ;law                    Shows the list
 
   Notes:
      Axmud can be set to auto-connect to one or more worlds when it starts.
      One way to do this is from the command line. Depending on your operating
         system, you might type one of these:
         
         perl axmud.pl
         ./axmud.pl

      Visually-impaired users would type one of these:

         perl baxmud.pl
         ./baxmud.pl

      You can add arguments to any of these commands. These arguments can be in
         one of these forms:

         <host> <port>
         <host>
         <world profile name>

      Alternatively, you can use the ';setautoworld' command.  Axmud stores a
         list of worlds to which it should auto-connect. This command displays
         that list.
      Each entry consists of a world profile name, and optionally one or more
         character profile names.
      Axmud won't connect to a world with the same character more than once, and
         it will ignore any world or character profiles that don't exist.
         
      Here is an example list, created with multiple uses of ';setautoworld':

         deathmud bilbo
         deathmud gandalf
         deathmud frodo sauron gandalf
         boringmud
         boringmud

      If 'boringmud' exists, Axmud creates six connections. If it doesn't exist,
         it creates only four. (Note that the duplicate 'gandalf' character is
         not used.)
