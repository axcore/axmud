smp / setmodelparent          Sets (or resets) the parent of a model object

   Format:
      ;smp <object>
               Sets the object to have no parent
      ;smp <object> <parent>
               Sets the object's <parent>

   Notes:
      The world model stores information about the regions, rooms, characters
         and objects in the game world. The automapper window uses the
         information stored in the world model to draw its maps.
      If the parent of an object is a room, the object is considered to be in
         the room. If the parent is a different kind of object, the object is
         considered to be 'inside' the parent.
      An object can have a region set as its parent (especially if the object's
         location varies frequently) or even have no parent set at all.

      <object> and <parent> must be valid world model object numbers. If
         <parent> is not specified, the object will have no parent.
      If <object> is a region, the <parent> (if specified) must also be a
         region. This command cannot be used to set or reset the parent of a
         room object - use ';moveroom' to do that.

   User commands:
      smp / setparent / setmodelparent
