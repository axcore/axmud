sim / simulateworld           Simulates text received from the world
 
   Format:
      ;sim <text>             Simulates <text>
 
   Notes:
      This command allows you to simulate the current world by 'inserting' one
         or more lines of text; Axmud will behave exactly as if the text had 
         been received from the world. It's a convenient way to test tasks, 
         Axbasic scripts, missions and triggers without interrupting the world 
         itself.

      To preserve spacing, enclose the text in diamond brackets <...>
      
         e.g. ;simulateworld <You kill the     orc!>
         
      To simulate several lines at a time, use '\n' for each newline character
      
         e.g. ;simulateworld <You kill the orc!\nYou kill the troll!>
         
      If <text> does not end with a newline character, one is added for you
         automatically.

      See also the help for ';simulateprompt', which inserts some text without
         adding a newline character.
