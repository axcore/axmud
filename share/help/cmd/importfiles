imf / importfiles             Imports a file (or files)
 
   Format:
      ;imf                    Imports file(s)
      ;imf <path>             Imports the specified file archive
 
   Notes:
      Axmud uses a fixed directory structure for its data files. Sometimes it's
         convenient to move data files somewhere else - for backup purposes, or
         to transfer them to another computer.
      ';importfiles' imports an archive file previously created with the
         ';exportfiles' command. An archive file consists of one or more Axmud
         files compressed into a single .tgz archive. <path>, if specified, 
         should be the full path to the archive file.
      Data from imported archive files is incorporated into Axmud's data files,
         but not loaded into memory. (The data in memory is not modified.) If
         the data files already exist, they are replaced.
      The config file is never exported or imported (because it contains data
         mostly relevant only to your current computer).
