dmd / dumpmodel               Lists all world model objects

   Format:
      ;dmd                    Shows all model objects

   Notes:
      The world model stores information about the regions, rooms, characters
         and objects in the game world. The automapper window uses the model to
         display its maps.
      This command dumps the list of model objects to the 'main' window. It
         should be used cautiously (because a large world model will take a very
         long time to be displayed).
      This command doesn't list exits (which are in the exit model).

   User commands:
      dmd / dumpmd / dumpmodel
