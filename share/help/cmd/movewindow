mwn / movewindow              Moves a window into a new zone

   Format:
      ;mwn <window> <workspace>
               Moves <window> to <workspace>
      ;mwn <window> <workspace> <zone>
               Moves <window> to <zone> in <workspace>

      ;mwn -r <window> <workspace>
               Moves <window> to <workspace> and resizes it
      ;mwn -r <window> <workspace> <zone>
               Moves <window> to <zone> in <workspace> and resizes it

   Notes:
      The workspace grid is an invisible grid, spanning the whole available
         workspace, on which Axmud tries to arrange its windows so that they
         don't overlap (as far as possible). The grid is divided into zones
         within which one or more windows are arranged. The 'blueprint' for
         zones on a desktop is called a 'zonemap'.
      Only 'grid' windows (including the 'main' window, task windows and the
         automapper window) are arranged on the workspace grid. Temporary
         windows, including the data viewer window and all edit, preference,
         wizard and dialogue windows, are not affected.

      This command moves a window to a specified zone on a specified workspace,
         or to the first available zone on a specified workspace (if no zone is
         specified.)
      <window> is the 'grid' window's number, which can be obtained from
         ';listwindow'.
      <workspace> is the workspace number, which can be obtained from
         ';listworkspace' (the workspace in which Axmud opens is #0).
      If specified, <zone> is the number of a zone in the workspace,
         specifically a zone on a workspace grid used by the window's session.
         A list of zone numbers can be obtained from ';listgrid'.

      If the '-r' switch is specified, the window will be resized to match the
         zone's default window size. Otherwise, the window will stay the same
         size (subject to minor adjustments to fill small gaps in the grid).
      '-r' can occur anywhere in the command, e.g. ';mwn 2 3 -r'
