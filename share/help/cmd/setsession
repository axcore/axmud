   Notes:
      A session is a single connection to a world (even if it's in offline mode
         and after a disconnection.) Each session has its own tab in the main
         window.
      This command customises the text displayed in the tab label.
      'xterm' titles are not used by most worlds, so turning them on may have no
         visible effect.
      Simple tabs are those shown without a label at all, when there's only one
         session open in a 'main' window. This is useful for conserving space on
         small monitors.
