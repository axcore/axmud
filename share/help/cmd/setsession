   Notes:
      A session is a single connection to a world (even if it's in offline mode
         and after a disconnection.) Each session has its own tab in the main
         window.
      This command can be used to customise the text displayed in the tab label.
      'xterm' titles are not used by most worlds, so turning them on may have no
         visible effect.
      Simple tabs are those shown without a label at all, when there's only one
         session open in a 'main' window. This is useful for conserving space on
         small monitors.

      When a session is disconnect from a world, it normally switches into a
         limited state in which some client commands are available, but most
         aren't. In addition, any tasks and 'edit' windows close immediately.
      If you use the '-o' switch, on disconnection the session will go into
         'offline' mode instead (just as if you had opened the Connections
         window and clicked the 'Connect offline' button).
