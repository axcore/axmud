rs / runscript                Runs an Axbasic script

   Format:
      ;rs                     Runs the script in the file test.bas
      ;rs <script>            Runs the script in the file <script>.bas
      ;rs -p <path>           Runs the script in the file <path>

   Notes:
      Axbasic is Axmud's own scripting language, based on the original Dartmouth
         BASIC and the later implementation by the same authors, True BASIC.
      As well as standard BASIC keywords and intrinsic (built-in) functions,
         Axbasic provides a number of keywords and functions especially designed
         to interact with the world and with Axmud's stored data. Use the
         ';axbasichelp' command for a list of keywords and functions.

      This command runs an Axbasic script without first creating a task. The
         script starts immediately and runs from beginning to end, without
         pausing.
      The ';runscripttask' command will run the script from inside an Axmud
         task. This provides the script with greater functionality (including
         the ability to pause); however, setting up the task requires a small
         fraction of a second, so the script itself won't start running
         immediately.

      When Axmud wants to load an Axbasic script, it checks a list of
         directories (called 'folders' on MS Windows systems), one at a time,
         until it finds a script with the right name. The first directory in the
         list is always the standard 'scripts' sub-directory, but the rest of
         the list is customisable (see the help for ';adddirectory').
      <script> should match the name of at least one file in these directories
         (without their .bas extensions). If you specify a <path> instead, it
         should be the full file path.
