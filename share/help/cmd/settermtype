stt / settermtype             Sets the data sent during TTYPE/MTTS negotiations
 
   Format:
      ;stt                    Shows current TTYPE/MTTS negotiation settings
      ;stt <switch>           Sets the type of data sent
      
      ;stt -n <name>          Sets the custom client name
      ;stt -n                 Resets the custom client name
      ;stt -v <version>       Sets the custom client version
      ;stt -v                 Resets the custom client version
      
   Notes:
      When you connect to a world, it negotiates with Axmud about which terminal
         type to use. Axmud sends a list of terminal types it supports, and the
         world chooses the most appropriate one. In somes cases the world might
         have special settings for particular clients, so Axmud can also send
         its own name and version.
      All of this happens invisibly if TTYPE/MTTS negotiation is enabled (see 
         the help for ';settelnetoption' and ';setmudprotocol').
      
      The default setting is to send the client's name, followed by a list of
         client-supported termtypes (for Axmud, the list is 'ansi', 'xterm', 
         'dumb' and 'unknown', sent in that order).
      You probably will never need to change the default settings, but if you
         do, this command is available. In particular, if you want to pretend to
         be using a different client, you can do so with this command.
         
      <switch>, if specified, sets what data is sent:
      
         -s   - Send nothing
         -a   - Send the client name, followed by the usual list of termtypes
         -x   - Send the client name and version, followed by the usual list of
                   termtypes
         -c   - Send a customised client name and version (see below), followed
                   by the usual list of termtypes
         -d   - Send only the the usual list of termtypes
         -u   - Send the termtype 'unknown'
         
      If you want to pretend to be using a different client, first use
         ';settermtype -c', and then use the '-n' switch to set a customised
         client <name> or the '-v' switch to set a customised client <version>.
         If you don't specify the <name> or <version>, Axmud's real name and 
         version are used.
