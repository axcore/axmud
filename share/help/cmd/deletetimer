dti / deletetimer             Deletes a timer

   Format:
      ;dti <switches>         Deletes a timer

   Notes:
      Timers are one of five types of Axmud interface (the others being
         triggers, aliases, macros and hooks).
      Timers allow you to send a world (or client) command repeatedly, at fixed
         intervals, and also to specify a command to be executed later.
      This command deletes an existing 'inactive' timer (one associated with a
         particular profile) and its corresponding 'active' timer, if there is
         one.
      It's not possible to delete an active timer directly; enable or disable
         the timer using ';modifytimer' to set its 'enabled' attribute instead.

      To delete the inactive timer (and the active timer based on it, if there
         is one), one of the following (group 1) switch options must be used:
         <name>               - Deletes timer belonging to the current world
         <name> -w            - Deletes timer belonging to the current world
         <name> -g            - Deletes timer belonging to the current guild
         <name> -r            - Deletes timer belonging to the current race
         <name> -c            - Deletes timer belonging to the current char
         <name> -x <category> - Deletes timer belonging to the current custom
                                   profile <category>
         <name> -d <prof>     - Deletes timer belonging to the profile named
                                   <prof>
