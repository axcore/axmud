rbu / retainbackups           Retains backup files after file-save operations
 
   Format:
      ;rbu on                 Turns backup retention on
      ;rbu off                Turns backup retention off
 
   Notes:
      Whenever Axmud saves a config file or a data file, it first creates a 
         temporary backup copy of the existing file (if there is one). If 
         something goes wrong with the save operation, the original file is 
         restored from the backup copy. 
      When backup retention turned off, the backup file is deleted as soon as 
         the save operation is complete. When it is turned on, the backup file
         is retained until the next save operation.
      Backup retention is turned on by default. Because Axmud is still in the 
         beta-testing phase, it is recommended that you leave it on. If your
         saved data becomes corrupted and Axmud refuses to load a particular 
         file, you may be able to manually restore the previous copy of the  
         corrupted file. 
      Relying on this functionality is not a good idea. You should still create 
         your own backup copy of the whole Axmud data directory (folder) on a
         regular basis, either by using client commands like ';exportfiles' or 
         by copying the directory manually.
