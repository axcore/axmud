      ;sap                    Lists commands to start external applicatons
 
   Notes:
      When you click on a website link or an email address, and when you want to
         play a sound effect or view a file, Axmud launches an external 
         application.
      <cmd> is the command used to start the external application. It should 
         contain '%s', which is substituted for the website to view, the email
         address to contact, the sound file to play or the text file to edit. 
         The <cmd> used will depend both on your operating system and on the 
         external application you prefer to use.
      ';sap -b' will reset the web browser command, meaning that Axmud won't be
         able to open a web browser at all. Similarly, ';sap -e' will reset the
         command used to send email.
      ';sap -a' will reset the audio player command, meaning that Axmud won't be 
         able to play any sound effects at all. (A better way to disable sound 
         effects is with the ';sound off' command.) 
      ';sap -t' will reset the text editor command. You won't be able to open
         source code files in an editor, but you can still view them in Axmud's
         native file viewer.
