dcs / deletecolourscheme      Deletes a colour scheme

   Format:
      ;dcs <name>             Deletes the colour scheme <name>

   Notes:
      A textview is a scrolling area of a window where text is displayed. A
         colour scheme determines the colours and font used in the textview.
      Axmud provides a standard set of colour schemes, one for each window type.
         These colour schemes can be modified but not deleted; all other colour
         schemes can be modified or deleted.

   User commands:
      dcs / delscheme / deletecolorscheme / deletecolourscheme
