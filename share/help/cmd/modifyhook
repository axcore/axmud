mhk / modifyhook              Modifies a hook
 
   Format:
      ;mhk <switches>         Modifies a hook
 
   Notes:
      Hooks are one of five types of Axmud interface (the others being triggers, 
         aliases, macros and timers).
      Hooks allow you to specify instructions to be executed automatically when
         certain events happen.
      This command modifies the attributes of an existing 'inactive' hook (one
         associated with a particular profile) and its corresponding 'active'
         hook, if there is one.
      It's also possibly to modify the active hook directly, in which case, the
         the changes won't apply to the parent inactive hook (and will only last
         for the session, or until the active hook is deleted).
      
      <switches> allows you to define which hook (and which of its attributes)
         should be modified.

      To modify the active hook directly, one of the following (group 0) switch 
         options must be used:
         -i <name>            - Modifies the active hook <name>
         -i <number>          - Modifies the active hook <number>
      However, to modify the inactive hook (and the active hook based on it, if
         there is one), one of the following (group 1) switch options must be
         used instead:
         <name>               - Modifies hook belonging to the current world
         <name> -w            - Modifies hook belonging to the current world
         <name> -r            - Modifies hook belonging to the current race
         <name> -g            - Modifies hook belonging to the current guild
         <name> -c            - Modifies hook belonging to the current char
         <name> -x <category> - Modifies hook belonging to the current custom
                                   profile <category>
         <name> -d <prof>     - Modifies hook belonging to the profile named
                                   <prof>
 
      One or more of the following group 2/3 switch options must be used.
      Group 2 switch options: 
         -s <event>           - Modifies the 'stimulus' attribute (a hook event)
         -p <instruction>     - Modifies the 'response' attribute (the   
                                   instruction to execute)
      Group 3 switch options: 
         -e <boolean>         - Modifies the 'enabled' attribute (1 or 0) 
         -t <boolean>         - Modifies the 'temporary' attribute (1 or 0, 
                                   default is 0)
      N.B. The 'name' attribute can't be modified.

      Group 4 switch options (only modify the inactive hook, so can't be used
         with the -i switch):
         -b <name>            - This hook is checked before hooks called <name> 
                                   (when they both become active)
         -y <name>            - This hook is not checked before hooks called 
                                   <name> (when they both become active)
         -f <name>            - This hook is checked after hooks called <name> 
                                   (when they both become active)
         -z <name>            - This hook is not checked after hooks called 
                                   <name> (when they both become active)

   General interface notes:
      If <instruction>, <pattern>, <string> or <substitution> contain 
         whitespace, they must be enclosed by diamond brackets
         
            e.g. <You see (.*) exits>
            
      <boolean> can be typed as 1 or 0, or any word beginning with t, T, f or F
