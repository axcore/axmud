ii / iinteract                Interacts with all matching target(s) in the room

   Format:
      ;ii                     Interacts with the first PC or NPC in the room
      ;ii <word>              Interacts with all targets matching <word>
      ;ii <word_list>         Interacts with all targets matching <word_list>

   Notes:
      ';iinteract' works in exactly the same way as ';interact', but with one
         important difference: whereas ';interact' only matches a single target
         for each argument, ';iinteract' matches all possible targets for each
         argument.
      So, ';iinteract guard' will interact with every guard in the room, and
         ';iinteract hairy orc' will attack every orc, and every being described
         as 'hairy'.
      See also the help for ';interact'.
