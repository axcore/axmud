sup / shutup                  Skips all text waiting to be read out

   Format:
      ;shutup                 Stops reading aloud

   Notes:
      When Axmud is performing text-to-speech, this command skips any text
         that's waiting to be converted to speech (including the current piece
         of text, if any). When new text is sent to be processed, it is
         converted to speech as usual.
      When running the version of Axmud that's optimised for visually-impaired
         users, the escape key can be used as a shortcut to this command (but
         only once Axmud is connected to a world, in online or offline mode.)
      Axmud remembers the last 1000 pieces of text that have been read aloud, so
         you can replay them at any time.
      See also the help for ';split', ';skip', ';unskip', ';first', ';last',
         ';resume' and ';freekeys'.
