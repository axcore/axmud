lat / listattribute           Lists text-to-speech attributes
 
   Format:
      ;lat                    Lists all attributes
 
   Notes:
      Tasks have various text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities, but some tasks don't
         use TTS at all. 
      Commands like ';read' and ';permswitch' allow you to interact with the TTS
         capabilities of tasks. When using these commands, you specify a TTS
         attribute - for example, the attribute 'title' in ';read title' 
         instructs the current Locator task to read the current room's title.
      There are three separate sets of TTS attributes - one for ';read' and
         ';permread'; one for ';switch' and ';permswitch', and another for 
         ';alert' and ';permalert'. 
      This command is used to list all three sets of attributes. Visually-
         impaired users might prefer to use ';read' and so on (without 
         specifying an attribute) to get a simpler list of attributes used with
         that command.
      Note that some attributes, such as 'health up', are stored as single 
         words; you can use either 'health up' or 'healthup' with the ';alert' 
         command.
