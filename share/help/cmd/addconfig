acf / addconfig               Adds a new text-to-speech configuration
 
   Format:
      ;acf <name>             Adds configuration <name> with default settings
      ;acf <name> <engine>    Adds configuration <name> using the <engine>
 
   Notes:
      If you have one or more of the text-to-speech engines installed on your
         system, Axmud can use them to convert text to speech. The engines 
         currently supported are eSpeak, Flite, Festival and Swift. (Axmud also 
         uses a dummy engine, called 'none'. If Axmud tries to convert text to 
         speech using the dummy engine, you'll hear nothing.)
      Axmud stores a number of TTS configurations. Each configuration stores an 
         engine, voice, speed and pitch setting, among others. Text received 
         from the world uses one configuration, system messages use another, so 
         it's easy to customise the configurations so that they read aloud in  
         different voices.
      You can use this command to add a new configuration. You can then use the 
         ';modifyconfig' command to modify the new configuration and the 
         ';speak' command to test it, if you want to.
      If you specify <engine> it should be one of Axmud's supported 
         text-to-speech engines: 'espeak', 'flite', 'festival', 'swift' or 
         'none'. If you don't specify an engine, 'espeak' is used.
