cmt / comment                 Adds a comment to the current recording

   Format:
      ;cmt <comment>          Adds a comment

   Notes:
      Adds a comment to the current recording. Comments are useful if the
         recording is saved as a mission, but will be ignored if the recording
         is saved as a route.
      A mission is typically divided into groups of commands, separated by
         breaks. Just before a break, it's common to insert a comment - which is
         displayed in the 'main' window - to explain to the user what is going
         on, or to instruct them to perform some task (by themselves) during the
         break.
      See the help for the ';record' command for more information about
         recordings.
