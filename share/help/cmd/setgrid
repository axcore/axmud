   Notes:
      The workspace grid is an invisible grid, spanning the whole available
         workspace, on which Axmud tries to arrange its windows so that they 
         don't overlap (as far as possible). The grid is divided into zones 
         within which one or more windows are arranged. The 'blueprint' for 
         zones on a desktop is called a 'zonemap'. 
      Only 'grid' windows (including the 'main' window, task windows and the 
         automapper window) are arranged on the workspace grid. Temporary
         windows, including the GUI window and all edit, preference, wizard and
         dialogue windows, are not affected.

      These settings apply to all workspace grids across all sessions. Use the
         ';listgrid' command to see the current settings.
      <flag> can be 1, 0 or any word beginning with either 't' (for 'true') or
         'f' (for 'false').
