sac / setautocomplete         Sets auto-complete options

   Format:
      ;sac                    Shows current auto-complete options
      ;sac <switches>         Sets auto-complete options

   Notes:
      When typing instructions/world commands in the 'main' window (and,
         occasionally, in other windows), you can use the 'tab' key to
         auto-complete the text and the 'up'/'down' keys to navigate through
         previous instructions/world commands.
      <switches>, if specified, change the current auto-complete options and can
         occur in any order. There are three groups of switches; switches from
         any single group can't be combined.

      Group 1: what happens when the user presses the tab/up/down
         -x   - Nothing happens
         -a   - Axmud auto-completes the instruction/world command or navigates
                  through previous instructions/world commands

      Group 2: which buffer is searched to provide the next item
         -i   - The instruction buffer is used (see the help for
                  ';instructionbuffer')
         -w   - The world command buffer is used (see the help for
                  ';commandbuffer')

      Group 3: which class of buffer is used
         -s   - Use this session's instruct and world command buffers
         -c   - Use the combined buffers, which include instructions/world
                   commands from all sessions

   User commands:
      sac / setauto / setautocomplete
