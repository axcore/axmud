adp / adddivertpattern        Adds a pattern for Divert tasks

   Format:
      ;adp <type> <pattern>
               Adds a <pattern> of <type>
 
   Notes:
      The Divert task intercepts text received from the world and displays it in
         its own task window.
      Three types of pattern are used - one for 'tell' messages (private 
         communications between one player and another), another for 'social'
         messages (public communications, for example chat channels) and a third
         containing patterns matching any kind of text that the user wants to
         divert.
      In addition, the world profile stores three lists of exceptions to these
         rules. If a 'tell' message matches both the pattern 'tells you' and the
         exception pattern 'the police officer tells you', the text is not 
         diverted to the task window but is instead displayed in the main 
         window, as normal.
 
      <type> defines what kind of pattern is to be added:
         -t   'tell' patterns
         -e   An exception to a 'tell' pattern
 
         -s   Social patterns
         -o   An exception to a social pattern
 
         -c   Gagged custom patterns (displayed in task window only)
         -u   Ungagged custom patterns (displayed in main and task windows)
         -x   An exception to a custom pattern
 
      <pattern> is a Perl regular expression. If <pattern> contains spaces, it 
         should be enclosed within diamond brackets <...>
