scp / setcustomprofile        Sets a current custom profile

   Format:
      ;scp <name> <template>
               Sets the current custom profile based on <template> to <name>

      ;scp <name>
               Sets the current custom profile to <name>

   Notes:
      Besides having a guild profile and a race profile, characters can have any
         number of custom profiles marked as a current profile.
      Profile names must be no longer than 16 characters, contain only A-Z, a-z,
         underlines and 0-9 (not the first character) and not be one of Axmud's
         reserved names (see the ';listreserved' command). Non-Latin alphabets
         are acceptable.
      If the custom profile <name> doesn't already exist, it is created (but, in
         that case, <template> must be specified).

   User commands:
      scp / setcustom / setcustomprof / setcustomprofile
