rcd / record                  Starts or stops a recording

   Format:
      ;rcd                    Starts or stops a recording

   Notes:
      You can use recordings to make a temporary copy of all commands sent to
         the world, in the order in which they were sent. It's a convenient way
         to create new missions and routes.
      Only one recording can be made at a time and they are not stored when you
         terminate Axmud (but any missions or routes you create using a
         recording are saved as normal). When you start a new recording, the
         previous recording (if any) is destroyed.
      Use ';record' to start a new recording, and then use ';record' again to
         stop recording.
      Recordings only store commands sent to the world, by default. However, if
         you're planning to use the contents of a recording to create a mission,
         you can artificially insert client commands, comments and breaks (as
         well as world commands that haven't actually been sent to the world)
         using the commands ';worldcommand', ';clientcommand',
         ';speedwalkcommand', ';comment' and ';break'.
      See also the help for ';pauserecording', ';insertrecording',
         ';deleterecording', ';listrecording' and ';copyrecording'.

   User commands:
      rcd / record
