otw / opentaskwindow          Opens a task's own window

   Format:
      ;otw <task>             Opens a task window for <task>
      ;otw -a                 Opens windows for all current tasks (if possible)

   Notes:
      ';opentaskwindow -a' opens a task window for all tasks that don't have one
         open (but which are allowed to have one open). Depending on the task's
         requirements, a task window can be either a separate 'grid' window, or
         it can be a window pane within the session's 'main' window.
      <task> can be any Axmud built-in or external task that's currently
         running.
      <task> can be in the form of a task's label (e.g. 'stat, 'status'), its
         formal name (e.g. 'status_task') or the task's unique name (e.g.
         'status_task_4').
      (Use the ';listtasklabel' command to list all task labels.)
