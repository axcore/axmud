usk / unskip                  Reads aloud the previous piece of text
 
   Format:
      ;usk                    Reads aloud the previous piece of text
      ;usk <num>              Unskips <num> pieces of text
      ;usk more               Unskips 10 pieces of text
      
   Notes:
      When Axmud is performing text-to-speech, this command replays the previous
         piece of text (if any). If some text is already being read aloud, it is
         interrupted.
      When running the version of Axmud that's optimised for visually-impaired 
         users, the left cursor key can be used as a shortcut to this command 
         (but only once Axmud is connected to a world, in online or offline 
         mode.)
      Axmud remembers the last 1000 pieces of text that have been read aloud, so
         you can replay them at any time. If Axmud is already replaying the
         first remaining piece of text, it is replayed again.

      You can also specify the number of pieces of text to unskip. If this takes
         you past the first job, then the first job is read aloud. 
      When running the optimised version of Axmud, the page up key can be used
         as a shortcut for ';unskip more'.
                           
      See also the help for ';split', ';skip', ';first', ';last', ';resume',
         ';shutup' and ';freekeys'.
