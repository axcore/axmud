izmp / inputzmp               Sends pre-formatted text via ZMP
 
   Format:
      ;izmp <line> <line>...  Sends multi-line world command
      
   Notes:
      The world can use the ZMP protocol to send extra information about the 
         game state (see the help for ';zmp'). 
      The client can also use ZMP to send information back to the world, 
         typically to request more data.

      This client command uses the ZMP 'zmp.input' command, which is intended
         for sending blocks of pre-formatted text (containing newline
         characters).

      You must specify at least one <line>. If you specify multiple <line>s,
         they are joined together in a single string, separated by a newline
         character (which is created for you).
      If the <line> contains whitespace, you must enclose within diamond
         brackets <...>. For example, this command sends two lines as a single
         ZMP command:

         ;izmp Hello world

      This command sends a single line a ZMP command:
         
         ;izmp <Hello world>
        
   User commands:
      izmp / inputzmp
