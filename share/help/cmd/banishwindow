bwn / banishwindow            Removes an 'external' window from a workspace grid
 
   Format:
      ;bwn                    Banishes all 'external' windows
      ;bwn <number>           Banishes 'external' window <number>
 
   Notes:
      The workspace grid is an invisible grid, spanning the whole available
         workspace, on which Axmud tries to arrange its windows so that they 
         don't overlap (as far as possible). The grid is divided into zones 
         within which one or more windows are arranged. The 'blueprint' for 
         zones on a desktop is called a 'zonemap'. 
      Only 'grid' windows (including the 'main' window, task windows and the 
         automapper window) are arranged on the workspace grid. Temporary
         windows, including the GUI window and all edit, preference, wizard and
         dialogue windows, are not affected.

      'external' windows are any window not created by Axmud. Sometimes it's
         convenient to place an 'external' window on one of Axmud's workspace
         grids so that it doesn't overlap Axmud windows (as far as possible).
         Use the ';grabwindow' command to do that, and use this command to 
         remove it from the workspace grids and restore it to its original size
         (for convenience, the window is also minimised).
      A window's <number> can be obtained with the ';listwindow' command.
