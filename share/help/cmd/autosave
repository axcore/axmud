ats / autosave                Turns auto-saves on/off

   Format:
      ;ats                    Shows current auto-save settings
      ;ats on                 Turns auto-saves on
      ;ats off                Turns auto-saves off
      ;ats <minutes>          Sets the time between auto-saves

   Notes:
      Autosaving is turned on by default.
      ';autosave on' and ';autosave off' turn auto-saves on/off for every
         session, but each session performs its own auto-save operation (so
         those operations will probably be staggered).
      If specified, <minutes> must be an integer number. The default time
         between autosaves is five minutes, and the minimum value is one minute.
      Autosaves don't take place when in 'offline' mode.
