ats / autosave                Turns auto-saves on/off
 
   Format:
      ;ats                    Shows current auto-save settings
      ;ats on                 Turns auto-saves on
      ;ats off                Turns auto-saves off
      ;ats <minutes>          Sets the time between auto-saves
 
   Notes:
      ';autosave on' turns on auto-saves for every session, but each session 
         performs its own auto-save operation.
      <minutes> must be an integer number. The default time between autosaves
         is five minutes, and the minimum value is one minute.
