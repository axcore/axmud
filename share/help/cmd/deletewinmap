   Notes:
      Winmaps are a plan for arranging the layout of 'internal' windows 
         (consisting of all 'main' windows, 'protocol' windows such as those 
         created by MXP, and 'custom' windows such as task windows).
      See the help for ';addwinmap' for more information about winmaps.

      Axmud provides a number of standard winmaps which can't be modified or
         deleted.
 
   User commands:
      dwm / delwm / deletewm / deletewinmap
