sdb / setdisplaybuffer        Sets the size of display buffers
 
   Format:
      ;sdb <size>             Sets the buffer <size>
      ;sdb                    Sets the buffer size to 10000
 
   Notes:
      The display buffer is Axmud's record of any text received from the world 
         which was displayed in the session's default tab (see the help for 
         ';displaybuffer').

      All display buffers have the same size, which can be changed with this
         command. If specified, <size> must be an integer in the range 
         10-1000000.
      The buffer size is not related to the number of lines that can be 
         displayed in a textview (this is a change from earlier versions of 
         Axmud). See the help for ';settextview'.
