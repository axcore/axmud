dsw / disablesaveworld        Disables saving files associated with a world

   Format:
      ;dsw <world>            Disables saving files for the <world>
      ;dsw                    Disables saving files for the current world

   Notes:
      A single world is saved in three data files (the file types 'worldprof',
         'otherprof' and 'worldmodel').
      You can use this command to prevent data currently stored in memory from
         being saved to these files. Other profiles and other types of file are
         not affected.
      Once saving has been disabled, it will not be re-enabled until you load
         the files (or until you restart Axmud.)
      The ';disablesaveload' command can be used to disable file saving/loading
         in all sessions.
      Even after using this command, the ';emergencysave' command will still be
         available.

   User commands:
      dsw / disablesaveworld
