tf / testfile                 Tests a data file
 
   Format:
      ;tf -i                  Identifies a data file's type
      ;tf -h                  Displays a data file's header
      ;tf -c                  Displays the contents of data file
 
   Notes:
      This is a debug command. It can be used to check whether a file is a valid
         Axmud data file, or not; but its primary purpose is to test a data file
         created by a different version of Axmud that cannot be loaded/imported,
         in an effort to find out what the problem might be.
      This command doesn't work with Axmud config files, which can be examined
         in a normal text editor.
