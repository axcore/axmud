asc / addstatuscommand        Adds a command to those sent by Status task
 
   Format:
      ;asc <cmd> <interval>   Adds a Status task command
      ;asc <cmd>              Adds a Status task command with default interval
 
   Notes:
      In 'active' mode, the Status task sends commands to the world every few
         seconds (usually commands like 'score', 'sc' and 'time') to keep the
         task's statistics up to date.
      <cmd> is the command to add, and <interval> is the gap in seconds until
         the same command is sent again. If <cmd> already exists in Status 
         task's command list, it is replaced (with the new specified interval). 
         If <interval> is not specified, a default value of 30 seconds is used. 
         <interval> must be a positive integer.
      If <cmd> contains spaces, you must surround it with diamond brackets,
         e.g. <go north>
      This command can only be used when the Status task is in 'disactivated' 
         mode. Use ';disactivatestatustask' to disactivate the task.
