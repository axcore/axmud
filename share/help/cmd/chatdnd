dnd / chatdnd                 Sends a 'do not disturb' request to chat contacts

   Format:
      ;dnd -n <name>          Sends request to chat contacts called <name>
      ;dnd -g <group>         Sends request to everyone in the <group>
      ;dnd                    Sends request to everyone

   Notes:
      The Chat task is used to chat with other players directly via telnet.
         Calls can be placed (or accepted) with any user whose MUD client uses
         the zChat or MudMaster protocols.
      This command is the equivalent of typing ';dnd' in the relevant Chat task
         windows. Note that 'do not disturb' requests can only be sent in chat
         sessions using the MudMaster protocol. You'll get an error message if
         you try to send it in a zChat session.
      The switches -n and -g can't be combined.

   User commands:
