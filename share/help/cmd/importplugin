ipl / importplugin            Imports an Axmud plugin
 
   Format:
      ;ipl                    Imports a plugin 
      ;ipl <path>             Imports the plugin whose file path is <path>
 
   Notes:
      Axmud plugins are Perl modules which allow you to extend Axmud's core 
         functionality with new tasks, client commands, cages, 'edit' windows 
         and menu items, all of them integrating seemlessly with the existing 
         Axmud code.
      Because of an unresolved Perl issue, plugins can only be loaded from
         Axmud's data directory. If you've downloaded a plugin (for example,
         from the Axmud website), you should use this command before trying to
         load the plugin with 'loadplugin'.
      This command copies the plugin to the correct location in Axmud's data
         directory.

   User commands:
      ipl / importplugin
