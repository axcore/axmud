   Notes:
      The Chat task is used to chat with other players directly via telnet.
         Calls can be placed (or accepted) with any user whose MUD client uses
         the zChat or MudMaster protocols.

      Commands with -i, -c and -u automatically apply to all running Chat task
         sessions and are remembered for future sessions.
      Commands with -a, -f, -p, -v, -s -z and -e apply only to the Chat tasks
         specified by <switches>. <switches> can be any of the following:
            (none)       - Applies to all Chat task sessions
            -g <group>   - Applies to the group called <group>
            -n <name>    - Applies to the chat contact called <name
      Switches can't be combined.
