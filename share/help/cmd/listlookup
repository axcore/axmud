llu / listlookup              Shows the list of IP lookup servers
 
   Format:
      ;llu                    Shows the list
      
   Notes:
      Some parts of the code need to know your IP address (for example, the Chat
         task, and the MNES protocol). Axmud does this by contacting some IP
         lookup servers.
      This command shows the customised and default lists of lookup servers, as
         well as your current IP address.
      See also the help for ';setlookup', ';resetlookup' and ';forcelookup'.
