epl / enableplugin            Enables an Axmud plugin
 
   Format:
      ;epl <name>             Enables the plugin <name>
 
   Notes:
      Axmud plugins are Perl modules which allow you to extend Axmud's core 
         functionality with new tasks, client commands, cages, 'edit' windows 
         and menu items, all of them integrating seemlessly with the existing 
         Axmud code. (Strip and table objects defined by a plugin are always 
         available, once the plugin is loaded.)
      This command re-enables an Axmud plugin which has been disabled with the
         ';disableplugin' command. (Axmud plugins are automatically enabled when
         they are first loaded.)
      See the help for ';loadplugin' for more information about Axmud plugins.  

   User commands:
      epl / enableplugin
