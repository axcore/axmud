rd / read                     Tells a task to read something aloud

   Format:
      ;rd <attribute>
      ;rd <attribute> <value>
                              Tells a task to read something aloud

      ;rd                     Get a list of available <attribute>s

   Notes:
      Tasks have various text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities, but some tasks don't
         use TTS at all. The ';read', ';switch' and ';alert' commands allow you
         to interact with the TTS capabilities of individual tasks.
      To modify the way that tasks process speech in general, use the ';speech'
         and ';editconfig' commands. TTS for tasks is turned off, by default, so
         you won't hear anything until you turn it on with the ';speech'
         command.

      This command is used to read something aloud; for example, it can be used
         to tell the Status task to read aloud your current character's health
         points, or it can be used by the Locator task to read aloud the current
         room's list of exits.
      <attribute> specifies what you would like the task to read. Some
         <attribute>s have a <value>. For example, you can use the <description>
         attribute with a <value> of 100, to tell the Locator task to read aloud
         the first 100 letters of the current room's description.
      <attributes> consist of one or more words. Actually, they are stored as a
         single word, so the (imaginary) attribute 'big foot' can be typed as
         'bigfoot', if you prefer.
      If you don't specify an <attribute> at all, a list of available attributes
         will be displayed.
      In some cases, a task might store the <value> you specify, for later use
         (you can use the ';permread' command to store the <value> in tasks
         which start automatically at the beginning of a session). However, none
         of Axmud's built-in tasks behave in this way.
      A task must be running before you can use this command to tell it to read
         something aloud.

      This is a list of all the <attribute>s used by this command with Axmud's
         built-in tasks. (The ';switch' and ';alert' commands use different
         attributes.)

         ;read descrip <chars>
         ;read description <chars>
            Reads the first <chars> characters of the current room's description
         ;read exit
         ;read exits
            Reads the current room's exit list
         ;read content

         ;read health
            Reads the current character's health points. Note that world
