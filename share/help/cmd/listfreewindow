lfw / listfreewindow          Lists 'free' windows
 
   Format:
      ;lfw                    Lists all 'free' windows
      ;lfw -s                 Lists this session's 'free' windows
 
   Notes:
      'Free' windows are temporary windows that are never arranged on Axmud's
         workspace grids. 'Free' windows include the GUI window, the Connections
         window, the About window, and all edit, preference, wizard and dialogue
         windows.
      This command lists all 'free' windows (except 'dialogue' windows) across 
         all sessions or (if -s is specified) for this session only. 
      Use the ';listwindow' command to list 'grid' windows.
