rgr / resetgrid               Resets workspace grids

   Format:
      ;rgr <num>              Resets workspace grid <num>
      ;rgr <num> <zonemap>    Resets workspace grid <num> using <zonemap>

      ;rgr -s                 Resets workspace grids for this session
      ;rgr -s <zonemap>       Resets this session's grids using <zonemap>

      ;rgr -w <num>           Resets grids on workspace <num>
      ;rgr -w <num> <zonemap> Resets grids on workspace <num> using <zonemap>

   Notes:
      The workspace grid is an invisible grid, spanning the whole available
         workspace, on which Axmud tries to arrange its windows so that they
         don't overlap (as far as possible). The grid is divided into zones
         within which one or more windows are arranged. The 'blueprint' for
         zones on a desktop is called a 'zonemap'.
      Only 'grid' windows (including the 'main' window, task windows and the
         automapper window) are arranged on the workspace grid. Temporary
         windows, including the data viewer window and all edit, preference,
         wizard and dialogue windows, are not affected.

      This command is generally used to apply a new <zonemap> to a workspace
         grid. If you don't specify a zonemap, the grid is reset using its
         existing zonemap; if you've manually moved or resized any 'grid'
         windows, they will be restored to their original size and position.
      Use ';listworkspace' to get a list of workspace numbers, and use
         ';listworkspacegrid' to get a list of workspace grid numbers.
      This command can't be used with temporary zonemaps (such as those created
         by MXP).

      The ';toggleshare' command sets whether sessions should share a single
         'main' window, or not. When they don't share a single 'main' window,
         they instead share a single workspace grid. In that case, if you use
         the -s switch, all workspace grids are reset.

   User commands:
