   Notes:
      The Chat task is used to chat with other players directly via telnet.
         Calls can be placed (or accepted) with any user whose MUD client uses
         the zChat or MudMaster protocols.
      This command is the equivalent of typing ';sendfile' in the relevant Chat
         task windows.
      <file> is the full path to the file, e.g. '/home/myname/myfiles/pic.jpg'.
         If you don't specify a <file> you will be prompted to choose one.
      The switches -n and -g can't be combined.
 
   User commands:
