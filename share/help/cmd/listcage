   Notes:
      Cages contain lists of all the things associated with a particular
         profile. For example, there are command, trigger, alias, macro, timer 
         and hook cages belonging to each world, and another set of cages 
         belonging to each guild, race and character in the world.
      Cages are automatically created, cloned and destroyed when the associated 
         profiles are created, cloned and destroyed.
