spn / setpanel                Sets custom workspace panel (taskbar) sizes
 
   Format:
      ;spn <switches>         Sets custom panel sizes
 
   Notes:
      Panels are the areas at the edge of the desktop (workspace) that aren't
         available to any window. Often, at least one panel has some kind of
         'start' menu, a list of windows and several other icons, such as one
         displaying the date and time.
      This command specifies custom sizes for one or more panels. Usually, Axmud
         detects panel sizes for every workspace it uses, so you'll probably
         only need to use this command if detection fails. (Panel sizes 
         specified with this command override detected sizes).
      After specifying panel sizes, you can use the ';resetgrid' or ';testpanel'
         commands to adjust the position of windows on the desktop.
      
      <switches> consists of one or more of the following options, in any order: 
         -l <size>   - Sets the left panel size
         -l          - Resets the left panel size
         -r <size>   - Sets the right panel size
         -r          - Resets the right panel size
         -t <size>   - Sets the top panel size
         -t          - Resets the top panel size
         -b <size>   - Sets the bottom panel size
         -b          - Resets the bottom panel size

      See also the help for ';testpanel' and ';listpanel'.
