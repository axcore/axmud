rpb / replaybuffer            Replays display/command buffers in 'offline' mode

   Format:
      ;rpb                    Replays the whole of both buffers
      ;rpb <switches>         Replays part of the buffers

   Notes:
      The display buffer is Axmud's record of any text received from the world
         which was displayed in the session's default tab (see the help for
         ';displaybuffer'). The world command buffer is Axmud's record of
         individual commands sent to the world. (See the help for
         ';displaybuffer' and ';commandbuffer').
      ';savebuffer' can save the contents of one or both buffers, in whole or in
         part, to a buffer file. Later, when connected in 'offline' mode, the
         buffer file can be loaded with ';loadbuffer' and replayed, as if still
         connected to the world, with this command.

      If specified, <switches> can be one or more of the following switch
         options, in any order:
            -d          Replay the display buffer
            -c          Replay the world command buffer
            -b <time>   Replay the buffer(s), beginning at the <time>
            -e <time>   Replay the buffer(s), ending at the <time>
      If neither -d nor -c are specified, both buffers are replayed
         simultaneously. If neither -b or -e are specified, the whole buffer is
         replayed.
      Buffer files are saved in the 'buffers' data sub-directory. You can open
         the file in a text editor to get the <time>s you want (the first item
         in the file has the <time> 0).
