ach / addchar                 Adds a character profile
 
   Format:
      ;ach <name>             Adds the character profile <name>
      ;ach <name> <pass>      Adds a character profile and password
      ;ach <name> <pass> <account>
                              Adds a character, password and account name
 
   Notes:
      Profile names must be no longer than 16 characters, contain only A-Z, a-z,
         underlines and 0-9 (not the first character) and not be one of Axmud's 
         reserved names (see the ';listreserved' command). Non-Latin alphabets
         are acceptable.
      The operation will fail if a profile called <name> already exists or if
         <name> is invalid.
      If <pass> is specified, the password is set. Passwords can also be set in
         each world profile's 'edit' window and in the connections window.
      Some worlds make a distinction between your account name, and the
         character name. If so, you can specify the <account> name associated
         with this character.
      To create a character profile and set it as the current character profile,
         use the ';setchar' command.
