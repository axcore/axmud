las / listautosecondary       Lists preferred ways to draw secondary directions

   Format:
      ;las                    Lists preferred ways

   Notes:
      Axmud provides eighteen 'standard' primary directions - the sixteen
         compass directions (including 'north', 'northeast' and
         'northnortheast') as well as 'up' and 'down'. This standard set never
         changes.
      Axmud dictionaries store a custom set of primary directions, one for each
         standard direction. Dictionaries also store a set of secondary
         directions such as 'out' and 'in', this set can contain as many or as
         few directions as you want.
      For a list of primary and secondary directions stored in the current
         dictionary, use the 'listdirection' command.

      When the automapper creates a room with a secondary direction like 'out'
         or 'in', normally you have to tell it which direction it should be
         drawn on the map.
      If you'd prefer the automapper to draw all 'out' exits in one direction
         and all 'in' exits in another direction, you can use the command
         ';setautosecondary'.
      This command lists all custom secondary directions and the standard
         primary directions they've been allocated (if any).
