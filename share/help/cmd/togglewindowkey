twk / togglewindowkey         Toggles special keys used with Axmud windows

   Format:
      ;twk                    Shows current special key settings
      ;twk <switch>           Toggles a special key/key combination

   Notes:
      Several keys (or key combinations) on your keyboard have a special
         function. This command is used to enable or disable those functions.
         When disabled, the keys are available for use with Axmud macros.
      <switch>, if specified, can be any of the following:

         -s   - Enables/disables scrolling. When enabled, the page up/page down/
                   home/end keys cause window panes to scroll up or down. A
                   window pane is an area within many Axmud windows (such as the
                   'main' window and many task windows) which contains mostly
                   text. Not all window panes can be scrolled
         -m   - Enables/disables smooth scrolling. When enabled, using the page
                   up/page down keys scrolls the window pane by less than the
                   pane height (which is convenient if you're trying to read a
                   block of text). When disabled, the keys scroll the pane by
                   exactly the pane height
         -p   - Enables/disables auto-split screen mode. Some window panes
                   (including the default one, where text received from the
                   world is usually displayed) can be split into two, which is
                   convenient for reading a block of text, while new text is
                   being received. When enabled, the home key engages split mode
                   mode and the end key disactivates it. The page up/page down
                   keys have the same effect, if the pane is scrolled to the
                   bottom/top
         -t   - Enables/disables autocompletion of instructions in the 'main'
                   window's command entry box, using the tab and cursor up/down
                   keys
         -c   - Enables/disables switching between tabs in a window pane using
                   CTRL+TAB
