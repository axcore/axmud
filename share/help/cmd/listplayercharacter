lpc / listplayercharacter     Lists player characters (PCs) in the world model
 
   Format:
      ;lpc                    Lists all character objects
      ;lpc -a                 Lists all character objects alphabetically

   Notes:
      The world model stores information about the regions, rooms, characters
         and objects in the game world. The automapper window uses the model to
         display its maps.
      Most model objects can be listed with ';listmodelobject', including 
         player characters (model objects which represent a character in the 
         world). Player characters can also be listed using this command.

   User commands:
