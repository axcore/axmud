slu / setlookup               Sets the list of IP lookup servers

   Format:
      ;slu <list>             Sets the list
      ;sfw                    Empties the list

   Notes:
      Some parts of the code need to know your IP address (for example, the Chat
         task, and the MNES protocol). Axmud does this by contacting some IP
         lookup servers.
      This command sets the list of lookup servers. Every item in <list> should
         be a valid URL.
      If <list> is not specified, the list of servers is emptied. This is one
         way to prevent Axmud from fetching your IP address, and potentially
         sharing it with someone else.
      Use ';resetlookup' to reset the list to its default state, or
         ';listlookup' to show the list of servers.
      Your IP is only fetched once. If you need to replace the stored value, for
         some reason, you can use the ';forcelookup' command.
