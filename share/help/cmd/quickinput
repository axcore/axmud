inp / quickinput              Opens the Quick Input window
 
   Format:
      ;inp                    Opens the window
 
   Notes:
      Commands are usually entered in the entry box in the 'main' window. This
         command opens a larger window in which you can type multiple commands.
         The commands are executed when you click the 'Send' button.
         
      The window can also be used to type a quick Axbasic script. The script is
         executed when you click the 'Run' button. 
      The script is not saved in Axmud's data directory. If you want to create
         and edit scripts from within Axmud, use the Launch task.
