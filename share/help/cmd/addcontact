acn / addcontact              Adds someone to your contacts list

   Format:
      ;acn <name> <ip> <port> <protocol>
      ;acn <name> <ip> <port>
               Adds a new contact

      ;acn <name> <ip> <protocol>
      ;acn <name> <ip>
               Adds a new contact using the default port

   Notes:
      The Chat task is used to chat with other players directly via telnet.
         Calls can be placed (or accepted) with any player whose MUD client uses
         the zChat or MudMaster protocols.
      This command adds a contact to your contacts list, so you can call them
         using a command like:
            ';call fred'
         instead of having to remember their IP address in a command like:
            ';zcall 140.195.35.201 4050'

      <name> must be a unique name for the chat contact; ideally, you should use
         the same nickname the contact is using for themselves. <name> must be
         between 3 and 16 characters long.
      If you omit <port>, the default port used for chat sessions by most MUD
         clients (port 4050) will be used.
      <protocol> defines which chat protocol to use for outgoing calls:
         -m    Use the MudMaster protocol
         -z    Use the zChat protocol
      If you don't specify a <protocol>, the zChat protocol is used. It doesn't
         matter if your chat contact calls you using the other protocol; the
         Chat task can handle either one.

   User commands:
