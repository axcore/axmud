lcl / listcontentslines       Lists the collection of contentslines

   Format:
      ;lcl                    Lists unrecognised words

   Notes:
      The Locator task analyses room statements as they are received, and if it
         finds any unrecognised words in the line(s) containing the room's
         contents, it can store them in the current dictionary (see the help for
         ';collectunknownwords').
      The Locator task can also store the whole line(s), if that is more
         convenient.
      This command displays the collection of contents lines. See also the help
         for ';collectcontentslines' and ';emptycontentslines''.

   User commands:
      lcl / listcl / listcontents / listcontentslines
