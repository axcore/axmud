stop / stopcommand            Stops all repeating / excess commands

   Format:
      ;stop                   Stops sending commands

   Notes:
      Cancels all repeating commands created with ';repeat' and
         ';intervalrepeat'.
      If the current world profile specifies a maximum number of world commands
         per second, this command also cancels any that haven't yet been sent.
