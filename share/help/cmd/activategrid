agr / activategrid            Activates (turns on) workspace grids

   Format:
      ;agr
               Activates workspace grids generally
      ;agr -z <zonemap>
               Activates grids generally using <zonemap>

      ;agr <num>
               Activates grids on workspace <num>
      ;agr <num> -z <zonemap>
      ;agr -z <zonemap> <num>
               Activates grids on workspace <num> using <zonemap>

   Notes:
      The workspace grid is an invisible grid, spanning the whole available
         workspace, on which Axmud tries to arrange its windows so that they
         don't overlap (as far as possible). The grid is divided into zones
         within which one or more windows are arranged. The 'blueprint' for
         zones on a desktop is called a 'zonemap'.
      Only 'grid' windows (including the 'main' window, task windows and the
         automapper window) are arranged on the workspace grid. Temporary
         windows, including the data viewer window and all edit, preference,
         wizard and dialogue windows, are not affected.

      If a workspace <num>ber is specified, workspace grids are turned on for
         that workspace only (use ';listworkspace' to get a list of workpace
         numbers). Any Axmud 'grid' windows on that workspace are arranged on
         the workspace grid.
      Otherwise, workspace grids are turned on for all workspaces, and this
         setting is also applied the next time Axmud starts.

      If a <zonemap> name is specified, that zonemap is made the default zonemap
         for every affected workspace. This command can't be used with temporary
         zonemaps (such as those created by MXP).

      In certain circumstances (such as when the desktop is too small, and also
         on MS Windows), Axmud is unable to create workspace grids at all, in
         which case this command can't be used.
      In that situation, you should read the help for ';togglewindowstorage'.
