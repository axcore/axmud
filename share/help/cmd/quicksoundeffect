qse / quicksoundeffect        Plays a sound effect without a system message

   Format:
      ;qse <name>             Plays the sound effect <name>

      ;qse <name> -f          Plays <name> and flashes the session 'main' window
      ;qse -f <name>

   Notes:
      Axmud's sound effects bank contains a list of named sound effects, each of
         which corresponds to a sound file. This command can be used to play
         sound effects in the bank.
      ';playsoundeffect' shows a system message when it plays a sound effect,
         and a system error message when it's unable to play a sound effect. You
         might prefer to avoid cluttering up the window with system messages,
         for example when you're creating a trigger whose response to a stimulus
         is to play a sound effect, in which case you can use this command
         instead.
      If you also specify the '-f' switch, the urgency hint for the session's
         'main' window is also set. The effect of this varies depending on the
         desktop environment you're using. Often, if cases the window to flash
         in the panel at the bottom (or top) of the screen.
