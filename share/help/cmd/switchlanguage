swl / switchlanguage          Uploads a phrasebook to the current dictionary

   Format:
      ;swl                    Displays a list of available phrasebooks
      ;swl <language>         Switches the current dictionary's language

   Notes:
      When Axmud dictionaries are created, their default contents are in
         English. However, Axmud also provides a small selection of mini-
         dictionaries (known internally as 'phrasebooks') which contain the
         bare minimum of words in some other languages.
      You can use this command to update the contents of a phrasebook to the
         current dictionary.
      The phrasebook contains primary directions (such as 'north', 'down' and
         'southwest'), articles (such as 'the', 'an'), some conjunctions (such
         as 'and', 'or') and number words from one to ten. These words are
         uploaded to the dictionary, replacing its previous contents. Other
         kinds of words (such as nouns, adjectives and time words) are not
         replaced.
      If you only want to change the current dictionary's named language
         ('English' by default), use the ';setlanguage' command.
