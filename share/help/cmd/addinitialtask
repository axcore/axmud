ait / addinitialtask          Adds a task to an initial tasklist

   Format:
      ;ait <task>
      ;ait <task> <switches>
               Adds the <task> to the global initial tasklist

      ;ait <task> <profile>
      ;ait <task> <profile> <switches>
               Adds the <task> to the <profile>'s initial tasklist

   Notes:
      Initial tasks are started when Axmud marks the current character as logged
         in (you can use the ';login' command to override the automatic process,
         if necessary), or when the user changes a current profile with commands
         like ';setworld' and ';setchar'.
      There are two types of initial tasklist - one 'global' list which contains
         a list of tasks which apply to every world, and a separate set of
         initial tasklists stored in each profile.
      When a current profile changes, any tasks that were created from the old
         profile's initial tasklist are halted before the new current profile's
         initial tasks are started.

      <task> can be any Axmud built-in or external task.
      <task> can be in the form of a task's label (e.g. 'stat', 'status') or its
          formal name (e.g. 'status_task').
      (Use the ';listtasklabel' command to list all task labels.)

      <switches> specify the settings that will apply to the task, once it
         actually starts.
      Group 1 <switches>: 0 or 1 switch from:
         -i               - Start <task> immediately (default setting)
         -e <other_task>  - Wait for <other_task> to exist, before starting
                               <task>
         -n <other_task>  - Wait for <other_task> to not exist, before starting
                               <task>
         -s <other_task>  - Wait for <other_task> to start, then stop, before
                               starting <task>
         -t <minutes>     - Start <task> <minutes> from now

      Group 2 <switches>: 0 or 1 switch from:
         -d               - Run <task> for an unlimited amount of time (default)
         -f <minutes>     - Run the task for <minutes>
         -u <timer>       - Run the task until the task loop reaches <timer>
                               (seconds since the session began)

      Group 3 <switches>: 0 or 1 switch from:
         -w               - Run the task without opening its own window (if it
                               usually opens one when it starts)

   User commands:
      ait / addinittask / addinitialtask
