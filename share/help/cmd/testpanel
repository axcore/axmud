tpn / testpanel               Detects sizes of workspace panels (taskbars)

   Format:
      ;tpn                    Tests panels on the default workspace
      ;tpn <num>              Tests panels on workspace <num>

   Notes:
      Panels are the areas at the edge of the desktop (workspace) that aren't
         available to any window. Often, at least one panel has some kind of
         'start' menu, a list of windows and several other icons, such as one
         displaying the date and time.
      This command tries to detect the size and position of panels. If a
         workspace <number> isn't specified, the test is performed on the
         default workspace (the one in which Axmud opened - use ';listworkspace'
         to get a list of workspaces).
      If the test is successful, those details are used when positioning windows
         on that workspace. (If you prefer, you can specify fixes panel sizes
         using the ';setpanel' command; these sizes override the sizes detected
         by any test.)
      If the test fails, Axmud will use a set of default panel sizes.

      Panels are tested automatically when Axmud first runs, and whenever Axmud
         starts using a new workspace (see the help for ';useworkspace'), so
         you'll probably only need to use this command if you change your
         desktop theme (or if you use the ;setpanel' command).
      See also the help for ';listpanel'.
