dch / deletechar              Deletes a character profile
 
   Format:
      ;dch <name>             Deletes the character profile <name>
 
   Notes:
      This operation deletes the character and all its associated cages,
         including all the interfaces stored in the cages.
      If the character has been assigned a current guild, current race or any
         current custom profiles, they will be unset as current profiles (but 
         not deleted).
      If <name> is the current character profile, there will be no current 
         character profile after using this command.

   User commands:
      dch / delchar / deletechar
