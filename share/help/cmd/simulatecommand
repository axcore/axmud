scm / simulatecommand         Simulates a world command

   Format:
      ;scm <cmd>              Simulates <cmd>

   Notes:
      This command allows you to simulate sending a world command. Axmud will
         behave exactly as if the command were actually being sent. It's a
         convenient way to test aliases without interrupting the world itself.
      If the command includes spaces, it must be enclosed within diamond
         brackets <..>, e.g.

            ;simulatecommand <drink potion>

   User commands:
