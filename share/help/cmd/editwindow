ewn / editwindow              Opens an 'edit' window for a 'grid' window
 
   Format:
      ;ewn <number>           Views settings for 'grid' window <number>
 
   Notes:
      The workspace grid is an invisible grid, spanning the whole available
         workspace, on which Axmud tries to arrange its windows so that they 
         don't overlap (as far as possible). The grid is divided into zones 
         within which one or more windows are arranged. The 'blueprint' for 
         zones on a desktop is called a 'zonemap'. 
      Only 'grid' windows (including the 'main' window, task windows and the 
         automapper window) are arranged on the workspace grid. Temporary 
         windows, including the object viewer window and all edit, preference,
         wizard and dialogue windows, are not affected.

      This command open an 'edit' window to view settings for the specified 
         'grid' window. Use the ';listwindow' command to get a list of 'grid' 
         window numbers.
