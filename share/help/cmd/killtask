kt / killtask                 Kills (stops) a task immediately

   Format:
      ;kt <task>              Kills <task>
      ;kt -a                  Kills all current tasks

   Notes:
      <task> can be any Axmud built-in or external task that's currently
         running.
      <task> can be in the form of a task's label (e.g. 'stat, 'status'), its
         formal name (e.g. 'status_task') or the task's unique name (e.g.
         'status_task_4').
      (Use the ';listtasklabel' command to list all task labels.)
      If there is more than one task matching <task>, they will all be stopped
         immediately.

      ';killtask' is a debugging command, and is not the recommended way to stop
         tasks - it's almost always better to use ';halttask' instead.
      ';killtask' sets the task's status to 'finished', so the task won't
         actually stop until the start of the next task loop.
      Use ';pausetask' to just pause a task.

   User commands:
      kt / killtask
