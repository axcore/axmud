sls / setlightstatus          Sets the current light status

   Format:
      ;sls <status>           Sets the current light status to <status>
      ;sls                    Shows the current light status

   Notes:
      Worlds will often present different verbose room descriptions, depending
         on the time of day in the game world and how much light is illuminating
         the character's location.
      Axmud represents current conditions with a 'light status' (stored in the
         world model). This command sets the current light status.
      <status> must be one of the world model's recognised light status values
         (use the ';setlightlist' command to see them). The default light status
         is 'day'.

   User commands:
      sls / setlight / setlightstatus
