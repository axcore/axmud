gmcp / gmcp                   Shows GMCP data reported by the current world

   Format:
      ;gmcp                   Shows all GMCP packages
      ;gmcp <name>            Shows the package called or starting with <name>

   Notes:
      The world can use the GMCP protocol to send extra information about the
         game state. This information is normally invisible to the user when it
         is received by Axmud, but it is available for use with your tasks and
         scripts, and can also be viewed using this command.
      A GMCP package contains one or more pieces of data. Typical package
         <name>s include 'char.stats', 'char.items.inv' and 'room.info'. Names
         are case-insensitive.
      If you don't specify a <name>, all GMCP packages are shown.
      If a package called <name> doesn't exist, a list of GMCP packages that
         start with the <name> (if any) are shown. For example, you can use the
         <name> 'char' to show the packages 'char.stats' and 'char.items.inv'.

      Some GMCP packages are not sent to the client unless the client requests
         it in some way. For details about which GMCP packages you can request
         (if any), consult the world's own documentation and then use the Axmud
         client command ';sendgmcp'.
      The ATCP protocol is very similar (see the help for ';atcp').

   User commands:
