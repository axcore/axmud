dchp / deletechannelpattern   Deletes Channels/Divert task patterns

   Format:
      ;dchp <number>          Deletes the channel pattern <number>
      ;dchp -e <number>       Deletes the exception pattern <number>
 
   Notes:
      The Channels and Divert tasks intercept text received from the world and
         divert that text into their own task window. Sometimes the text is
         gagged, meaning that it's displayed in the 'main' window too. You can't
         run both tasks at the same time.
      The world profile stores a list of patterns. When a line of text which
         matches one of those patterns is received, it is diverted to the task
         window.
      (See the help for ';addchannelpattern' for a longer explanation.)

      This command deletes one of the patterns. Before using this command, you
         must use ';listchannelpattern' to get the <number> of the pattern you
         want to delete.
      If you want to delete an exception pattern, you must specify the '-e'
         switch, and you must first use ';listchannelpattern -e'.
