   Format:
      ;brk                    Adds a break
      ;brk -t <pattern>       Adds a trigger break using <pattern>
      ;brk -p <number>        Adds a pause break of <number> seconds
      ;brk -l                 Adds a Locator task break

   Notes:
      Adds a break to the current recording. Breaks are useful if the recording
         is saved as a mission, but will be ignored if the recording is saved as
         a route.
      A mission is typically divided into groups of commands, separated by
         breaks. During a mission, each group of commands is sent to the world
         all at the same time; the break separates this group from the next
         group of commands and allows the user to move onto the next group only
         when ready.
      There are four special kinds of breaks which allow for more flexible
         missions (see the help for ';startmission' for more information).
      The switches -t, -p and -l create a special break; otherwise an ordinary
         break is created.
      A trigger break creates an (active) trigger using <pattern> as its
         stimulus; when the trigger fires (i.e., when the world sends some text
         matching the <pattern>), the break is complete and the mission resumes.
         If <pattern> contains spaces, it should be surrounded by diamond
         brackets <...>
      A pause break creates an (active) timer. When the timer fires (after
         <number> seconds), the break is complete and the mission resumes.
         <number> can be an integer like '10' or a decimal like '10.4'.
      A Locator break waits until the Locator task is not expecting any more
         room descriptions. It's typically used after sending a lot of movement
         commands to the world, so that the mission can resume only when the
         character arrives.
      An ordinary break is complete when the user types ';mission', which
         resumes the mission.
      See the help for the ';record' command for more information about
         recordings.
