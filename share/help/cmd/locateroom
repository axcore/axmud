lrm / locateroom              Locates the current room in the world model
 
   Format:
      ;lrm                    Locates the current room
      ;lrm <mode>             Locates the room & sets the automapper window mode
 
   Notes:
      This command searches the world model, looking for a room that matches the
         Locator task's current room. Any matching rooms are displayed as a 
         list. In addition, if exactly one matching room is found, that room is 
         set as the automapper's current room. 
      If the automapper window isn't open, the automapper automatically begins
         tracking the character's location in the world model. If the window is
         open, you can change the operating <mode> at by specifying one of the 
         following switches:

         -w   - automapper window switches to 'wait' mode
         -f   - switches to 'follow' mode
         -u   - switches to 'update' mode

      Note that if 'update' mode is disabled, the automapper window switches to
         'follow' mode instead.

      The automapper window also has a room location function. It differs from 
         this command, in that all matching rooms are selected.
      See also the help for ';setroom'.
