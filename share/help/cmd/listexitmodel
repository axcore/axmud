lem / listexitmodel           Lists exit model objects

   Format:
      ;lem                    Shows the current state of the exit model
      ;lem <number>           Shows the exit model object <number>
      ;lem <start> <stop>     Lists exit objects numbered <start> to <stop>

   Notes:
      The world model stores information about the regions, rooms, characters
         and objects in the game world. The automapper window uses the model to
         display its maps.
      This command lists information about the state of the exit model, or else
         displays a summary for a selection of model objects (use
         ';dumpexitmodel' to display a list of all exit model objects).

      If <number> doesn't exist in the exit model, an error is displayed; but if
         either <start> or <stop> (or both) don't exist, all objects with
         numbers between them will be displayed.
