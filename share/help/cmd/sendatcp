satcp / sendatcp              Sends encoded JSON data to the world via ATCP

   Format:
      ;satcp <payload>        Sends an ATCP request to the world

   Notes:
      The world can use the ATCP protocol to send extra information about the
         game state (see the help for ';atcp').
      The client can also use ATCP to send information back to the world,
         typically to request more data. An ATCP <payload> is usually in the
         form:

         Package[.SubPackages].Message data

      Consult the world's own documentation for details of which ATCP requests
         it accepts.

   User commands:
      satcp / sendatcp
