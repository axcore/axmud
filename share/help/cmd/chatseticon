csi / chatseticon             Sets the icon used in chat sessions
 
   Format:
      ;csi <file>             Sets the icon used to <file>
      ;csi -d                 Use the default chat icon
      ;csi                    Choose an icon to use
 
   Notes:
      The Chat task is used to chat with other players directly via telnet.
         Calls can be placed (or accepted) with any user whose MUD client uses
         the zChat or MudMaster protocols.
      This command changes the icon broadcast to your chat contacts (you can see
         your partner's icon, and they can see yours).
      <file> is the full path to the file, e.g. '/home/myname/myfiles/pic.bmp'.
         If you don't specify a <file> you will be prompted to choose one.
      All icons must be in Windows bitmap (.bmp) format. Axmud comes with a 
         large selection of icons from which to choose. You'll find them in the
         /icons/chat directory.
