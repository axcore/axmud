dis / deleteinitialscript     Deletes a script from an initial scriptlist
 
   Format:
      ;dis <script>
               Deletes the <script> from the global initial scriptlist
      ;dis <script> <profile>
               Deletes the <script> from the <profile>'s initial scriptlist
 
   Notes:
      Initial scripts are started when Axmud marks the current character as 
         logged in (you can use the ';login' command to override the automatic 
         process, if necessary), or when the user changes a current profile with
         commands like ';setworld' and ';setchar'.
      There are two types of initial scriptlist - one 'global' list which
         contains a list of scripts which apply to every world, and a separate 
         set of initial scriptlists stored in each profile.
      Axbasic scripts are stored as files in Axmud's data directory (in the 
         'scripts' sub-directory). <script> matches the file name (without its
         .bas extension). This command deletes that script from the specified
         scriptlist.

   User commands:
      dis / delinitscript / deleteinitialscript
