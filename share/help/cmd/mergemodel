mmd / mergemodel              Imports and merges a world model file

   Format:
      ;mmd                    Merge a world model file

   Notes:
      This command can be used to combine multiple maps (world models) -
         possibly the work of several different authors - into a single map
         (world model).
      The first step is to connect to a world (in online or offline mode), and
         then to export a world model in the usual way:

            ;exportfiles -m <world_name>

      This will create a file that can be saved in a convenient location, or
         which can be sent to your friends.
      The same file can then be imported with this command. (Don't use
         ';importfiles', as that will replace your existing world model with the
         imported one.)

      The merge operation removes regions, rooms, exits and labels from the
         imported model and adds them to this session's existing model. If you
         import a region called 'town', it's renamed if there is already a
         region called 'town'.
      The operation also imports known characters, minion strings, light status
         values, teleport destination rooms, map label styles and custom room
         flags (but duplicates are not imported).
      Other world model settings are not imported. When the operation is
         complete, the imported world model is discarded.
