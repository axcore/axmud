cn / connect                  Connects to a new world

   Format:
      ;cn                     Opens the connections window

      ;cn <world>             Connects to the specified <world>
      ;cn <world> -o          Connects to the world in 'offline' mode

      ;cn <world> <char>      Connects to the <world> with the character <char>
      ;cn <world> <char> -o   Connects to the <world> in 'offline' mode

   Notes:
      This command connects to a new world in a new 'main' window (or in a new
         tab in a shared 'main' window).
      In offline mode, Axmud simulates a connection to the world; some client
         commands will be available, but others will not. The -o switch can
         appear anywhere in the command, so the following are interchangeable:

            ;connect deathmud gandalf -o
            ;connect -o deathmud gandalf

   User commands:
      cn / connect
