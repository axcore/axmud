sws / switchsession           Switches the current session

   Format:
      ;sws                    Switches to the next session
      ;sws <number>           Switches to session <number>
      ;sws -c                 Switches to this session
      ;sws <world>            Switches to the first session using <world>
      ;sws <world> <char>     Switches to the first session using <world>/<char>

   Notes:
      The current session is the one that's visible in the 'main' window. If
         different sessions each have their own 'main' window, it's the session
         whose 'main' window is in focus. (Use ';listsession' to get a list of
         sessions.)
      The first session created is session <number> 0. Session numbers are not
         reused when you close a session, so even if there are two sessions
         running, the second one might not be session <number> 1.
      The switch -c sets the session from which this command was processed as
         the current session. The -c switch is most useful if you want to switch
         sessions from within an Axbasic script.
      <world> and <char> are world and character profiles, respectively. If you
         specify <world>, the first matching session becomes the current session
         (sessions are checked in the order in which they were created.) If you
         specify <world> and <char>, the first session matching both profiles
         becomes the current session.
