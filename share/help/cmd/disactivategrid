dgr / disactivategrid         Disactivates (turns off) workspace grids
 
   Format:
      ;dgr                    Disactivates workspace grids generally
      ;dgr <num>              Disactivates grids on workspace <num>
 
   Notes:
      The workspace grid is an invisible grid, spanning the whole available
         workspace, on which Axmud tries to arrange its windows so that they 
         don't overlap (as far as possible). The grid is divided into zones 
         within which one or more windows are arranged. The 'blueprint' for 
         zones on a desktop is called a 'zonemap'. 
      Only 'grid' windows (including the 'main' window, task windows and the 
         automapper window) are arranged on the workspace grid. Temporary
         windows, including the object viewer window and all edit, preference,
         wizard and dialogue windows, are not affected.

      If a workspace <num>ber is specified, workspace grids are turned off for
         that workspace only (use ';listworkspace' to get a list of workpace
         numbers). Any Axmud 'grid' windows are on the workspace are not
         immediately moved or resized, so you won't notice any changes straight
         away. New 'grid' windows on the workspace will be opened using a
         default size and position.
      Otherwise, workspace grids are turned off for all workspaces, and this 
         setting is also applied the next time Axmud starts.

      In certain circumstances (such as when the desktop is too small), Axmud is
         unable to create workspace grids at all, in which case this command 
         can't be used.
