xal / exportalias             Exports an alias to the interface clipboard

   Format:
      ;xal <switches>         Exports an alias

   Notes:
      Aliases are one of five types of Axmud interface (the others being
         triggers, macros, timers and hooks).
      Aliases allow you to define shortcuts for world commands and to have those
         commands modified before being sent to the world.
      This command provides a simple way to copy aliases from one profile/cage
         to another (perhaps even in a different world, in a different session).
         It 'exports' the alias to Axmud's interface clipboard, from where it
         can be 'imported'.
      Note that the contents of the clipboard are not saved, when Axmud saves
         its files. Note also that the alias's attributes might change while
         stored in the clipboard. In other words, it's up to you to perform the
         export, then the import, before doing anything else.
      You can repeat this command as often as you like, to add multiple aliases
         to the clipboard, before importing them all together with
         ';importalias'. Use ';emptyclipboard' when you want to start afresh.
         Note that 'Export' buttons in preference/edit windows empty the
         clipboard, before adding one or interfaces to it.
      Both active and inactive aliases can be exported.

      <switches> allows you to define which alias (and which of its attributes)
         should be exported.

      To export an active alias directly, one of the following (group 0) switch
         options must be used:
         -i <name>            - Exports the active alias <name>
         -i <number>          - Exports the active alias <number>
      However, to export an inactive alias, one of the following (group 1)
         switch options must be used instead:
         <name>               - Exports alias belonging to the current world
         <name> -w            - Exports alias belonging to the current world
         <name> -r            - Exports alias belonging to the current race
         <name> -g            - Exports alias belonging to the current guild
         <name> -c            - Exports alias belonging to the current char
         <name> -x <category> - Exports alias belonging to the current custom
                                   profile <category>
         <name> -d <prof>     - Exports alias belonging to the profile named
                                   <prof>
