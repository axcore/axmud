chp / chatpeek                Shows chat contact's own public connections
 
   Format:
      ;chp -n <name>          Makes request to chat contacts called <name>
      ;chp -g <group>         Makes request to chat contacts in the <group>
      ;chp                    Makes request to everyone
 
   Notes:
      The Chat task is used to chat with other players directly via telnet.
         Calls can be placed (or accepted) with any user whose MUD client uses
         the zChat or MudMaster protocols.
      This command is the equivalent of typing ';peek' in the relevant Chat task
         windows. It displays a list of the chat contact's own chat connections 
         (but only those which have been marked as 'public'). See also the help
         for the ';chatrequest' command.
      The switches -n and -g can't be combined.
 
   User commands:
