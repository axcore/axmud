ls / listsession              Lists sessions

   Format:
      ;ls                     Lists sessions

   Notes:
      A session is a single connection to a world (even if it's in offline mode
         and after a disconnection.) Each session has its own tab in the main
         window.

   User commands:
      ls / listsession
