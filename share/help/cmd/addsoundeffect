ase / addsoundeffect          Adds a new sound effect
 
   Format:
      ;ase <name>             Adds (or replaces) an effect
      ;ase <name> -d          Adds (or replaces) an effect with no sound file
      ;ase -d <name>
 
   Notes:
      Axmud's sound effects bank contains a list of named sound effects, each of 
         which corresponds to a sound file. 
      This command adds a new sound effect to the bank (or replaces an existing
         one). A dialogue window will open from which you can choose a sound 
         file (such as an .mp3 file). However, if you use the '-d' switch, the
         sound effect will not be associated with a file; this will have the 
         effect of disabling the sound effect until you specify a file at some 
         later date.
      Sound effect names must be no longer than 16 characters, contain only A-Z, 
         a-z, underlines and 0-9 (not the first character) and not be one of 
         Axmud's reserved names (see the ';listreserved' command). Non-Latin
         alphabets are acceptable.
      If a sound effect called <name> already exists, it will be replaced.
      You can use the ';resetsoundeffect' command to restore the default sound
         effects bank. See the help for ';sound' for more information about the
         default sound effects bank.
