adr / adddirectory            Starts using directory containing Axbasic scripts
 
   Format:
      ;adr <dir>              Adds the directory <dir>
      ;adr                    Adds a directory
 
   Notes:
      When Axmud wants to load an Axbasic script, it checks a list of 
         directories (called 'folders' on MS Windows systems), one at a time, 
         until it finds a script with the right name.
      The first directory in the list is always the standard 'scripts'
         sub-directory, but the rest of the list is customisable. You can use 
         this command to add a directory to the end of the list.
      If you write multiple Axbasic scripts with the same name, the wrong one 
         might be loaded unexpectedly. For this reason, it's recommended that
         this list be kept as short as possible - ideally containing no more
         than two directories (or, even better, just one).
      <dir> is the full path to the directory. If it contains spaces, you will
         need to enclose it with diamond brackets, e.g.:
         
            ;addirectory <home/my_name/my_dir/scripts/kill.bas>
            
      If you don't specify <dir>, you will be prompted to choose one.

   User commands:
      adr / adddir / addfolder / adddirectory
