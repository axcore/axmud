cfw / closefreewindow         Closes a 'free' window
 
   Format:
      ;cfw                    Closes all 'free' windows
      ;cfw -s                 Closes this session's 'free' windows
      ;cfw <number>           Closes 'free' window <number>
 
   Notes:
      'Free' windows are temporary windows that are never arranged on Axmud's
         workspace grids. 'Free' windows include the GUI window, the Connections
         window, the About window, and all edit, preference, wizard and dialogue
         windows.
      If <number> is specified, that window is closed. (Use the 
         ';listfreewindow' command to get a list of 'free' window numbers.)
      Otherwise, all 'free' windows (except 'dialogue' windows) across all
         sessions are closed. If -s is specified, only this session's 'free' 
         windows are closed.
 
   User commands:
      cfw / closefreewin / closefreewindow
