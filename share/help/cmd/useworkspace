uws / useworkspace            Makes a workspace available for Axmud to use
 
   Format:
      ;uws                    Uses the next available workspace
      ;uws <number>           Uses the workspace with the system <number>
      ;uws <number> -z <zonemap>
      ;uws -z <zonemap> <mumber>

      ;uws <name>             Uses the workspace with the system <name>
      ;uws <name> -z <zonemap>
      ;uws -z <zonemap> <name>

   Notes:
      Axmud supports multiple desktops or 'workspaces'. Workspaces can be both
         real and virtual. If you have multiple physical monitors, each one is a
         workspace. If your computer has a workspace switcher, allowing you to 
         switch between virtual desktops, each one is a workspace too.
      This command adds one of your system's workspaces to the list of 
         workspaces Axmud is using. Axmud uses its own numbering system for 
         workspaces, which might not match the computer's numbering system. Use
         ';listworkspace' to get a list of available workspaces.
      If you don't specify a <name> or <number>, Axmud will use the first
         available workspace. The way in which Axmud selects the first available
         workspace can be modified with the ';setworkspacedirection' command.
      If you specify a <zonemap>, that zonemap is used as the default zonemap
         for the workspace. If you don't specify one, Axmud will choose a 
         default zonemap.

      To modify which workspaces Axmud uses when it starts, see the help for
         ';addinitialworkspace'.
