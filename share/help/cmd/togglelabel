tlb / togglelabel             Toggles toolbar button labels
 
   Format:
      ;tlb                    Toggles labels
      
   Notes:
      Toolbar buttons are drawn (by default) near the top of 'main' windows and
         in automapper windows. These buttons also have labels.
      On most Linux systems, the labels are only visible (in a drop-down list)
         when there is not enough space for all the buttons. On other systems,
         such as MS Windows, the labels are drawn regardless.
      On systems where labels are drawn underneath their icons, there isn't
         enough room for more than a few icons. Axmud tries to guess whether
         labels should be drawn, or not; you can use this command to switch
         between the two settings, if you need to.
