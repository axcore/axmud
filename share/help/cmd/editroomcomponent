ecm / editroomcomponent       Opens an 'edit' window for the room component

   Format:
      ;ecm <name>             Edits the room component <name>

   Notes:
      A room statement is a complete description of a room - typically including
         a room title, a verbose description, a list of exits and/or the
         contents of the room.
      When a room statement is received from the world, the Locator task
         attempts to extract those components. If it succeeds, the contents of
         each component are available to any code that needs it.

      The current world profile stores the settings needed to extract each
         component. If you're using a pre-configured world, the settings have
         already been set up for you.
      If not, you can use the locator wizard (see the help for ';locatorwizard')
         or you can change the settings yourself - either use the world's 'edit'
         window (see the help for ';editworld') or by using this command.
      Use the ';listroomcomponent' command for a list of the current world's
         room components.
