skp / skip                    Reads aloud the next piece of text
 
   Format:
      ;skp                    Reads aloud the next piece of text
      ;skp <num>              Skips <num> pieces of text
      ;skp more               Skips 10 pieces of text
      
   Notes:
      When Axmud is performing text-to-speech, this command replays the next
         piece of text (if any). If some text is already being read aloud, it is
         interrupted.
      When running the version of Axmud that's optimised for visually-impaired 
         users, the right cursor key can be used as a shortcut to this command 
         (but only once Axmud is connected to a world, in online or offline 
         mode.)
      Axmud remembers the last 1000 pieces of text that have been read aloud, so
         you can replay them at any time.          

      You can also specify the number of pieces of text to skip. If this takes
         you past the last job, then the last job is read aloud. 
      When running the optimised version of Axmud, the page down key can be used
         as a shortcut for ';skip more'.
         
      See also the help for ';split', ';unskip', ';first', ';last', ';resume',
         ';shutup' and ';freekeys'.

   User commands:
