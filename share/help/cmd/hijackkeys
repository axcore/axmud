hjk / hijackkeys              Toggles cursor (etc) keys for replaying TTS
 
   Format:
      ;hjk                    Toggles cursor (etc) keys
      
   Notes:
      When running the version of Axmud that's optimised for visually-impaired 
         users, some keys are used for replaying text that has been converted
         to speech.
      This command can be used to enable or disable that functionality, when
         running the normal of Axmud. (When running the optimised version, use
         the ';freekeys' command instead).

      They keys used (and their equivalent client commands) are:

         home         ;split
         end          ;prompt
         left         ;unskip
         right        ;skip
         up           ;first
         down         ;last
         page up      ;unskip more
         page down    ;skip more
         tab          ;resume
         escape       ;shutup

      See also the help for ';split', ';skip', ';unskip', ';first', ';last',
         ';resume' and ';shutup'.
