swz / setwindowsize           Sets the default size of 'grid' windows
 
   Format:
      ;swz                    Shows default 'grid' window sizes
      ;swz -m <wid> <hei>     Sets default size of 'main' windows
      ;swz -m                 Resets default size of 'main' windows
      ;swz -g <wid> <hei>     Sets default size of other 'grid' windows 
      ;swz -g                 Resets default size of other 'grid' windows 

   Notes:
      The workspace grid is an invisible grid, spanning the whole available
         workspace, on which Axmud tries to arrange its windows so that they 
         don't overlap (as far as possible). The grid is divided into zones 
         within which one or more windows are arranged. The 'blueprint' for 
         zones on a desktop is called a 'zonemap'. 
      Only 'grid' windows (including the 'main' window, task windows and the 
         automapper window) are arranged on the workspace grid. Temporary
         windows, including the GUI window and all edit, preference, wizard and
         dialogue windows, are not affected.

      The size of 'grid' windows normally depends on the grid in which they're
         arranged. However, if workspace grids are disactivated, windows are
         created using a default size which can be modified with this command.
      Actually, there are two default sizes: one for 'main' windows, and one for
         other types of 'grid' window. (The default size of 'free' windows can't
         be modified.)
      <wid> and <hei> are the width and height of the window; if specified, they
         must be numbers between 100 and Axmud's maximum desktop size.
