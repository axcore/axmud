sfc / setfacing               Sets the direction the character is facing

   Format:
      ;sfc <dir>              Sets the direction
      ;sfc                    Resets the direction

   Notes:
      A small number of worlds use relative directions like 'forward' and
         'left'. At these worlds, exits in a room can change depending on the
         way the character is facing (usually the direction in which the
         character entered the current room).
      If you specify <dir>, the automapper assumes the character is facing that
         direction, and interprets the exits in a room accordingly.
      <dir> can be any of the following primary directions (standard or custom,
         abbreviated or not):

         north south east west northeast southeast northwest southwest

      Whenever the character moves in one of those directions, the facing
         direction is updated; it can also be updated with this command.
      Using assisted moves also updates the facing direction; for example, if
         you mov through an 'enter portal' exit that's been drawn on your map in
         a northerly direction, the automapper will set the facing direction to
         'north'.
