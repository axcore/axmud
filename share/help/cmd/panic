boss / panic                  Stops the client and doesn't save files
 
   Format:
      ;boss                   Stops the client immediately
 
   Notes:
      Use this command to clear your desktop when you accidentally over-extend
         your lunchbreak (which is why the user command ';boss' redirects to 
         this command.) It's also the quickest way to terminate all of your
         connections in an emergency.
      By using this command, you will lose any changes you have made to Axmud's
         stored data. Use the ';stopclient' command to stop the client while
         still having the opportunity to save files.
