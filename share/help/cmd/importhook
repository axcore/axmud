ihk / importhook              Imports hook(s) from the interface clipboard

   Format:
      ;ihk <name> <switches>  Imports the hook called <name>
      ;ihk <switches>         Imports all clipboard hooks

   Notes:
      Hooks are one of five types of Axmud interface (the others being triggers,
         aliases, macros and timers).
      Hooks allow you to specify instructions to be executed automatically when
         certain events happen.
      This command provides a simple way to copy hooks from one profile/cage to
         another (perhaps even in a different world, in a different session).
         Having 'exported' the hook to Axmud's interface clipboard using the
         ';importhook' command, that hook can then be 'imported'.
      Note that the contents of the clipboard are not saved. Note also that the
         hook's attributes might change while stored in the clipboard. In other
         words, it's up to you to perform the export, then the import, before
         doing anything else.
      If an active hook was exported, an inactive hook is imported. The imported
         hook will not replace an existing hook with the same name.

      <switches> allows you to specify which profile's hook cage should receive
         the imported hooks. One of the following (group 1) switches
         may be specified:
         (no switch)   - Imports hook(s) to the current world
         -w            - Imports hook(s) to the current world
         -r            - Imports hook(s) to the current race
         -g            - Imports hook(s) to the current guild
         -c            - Imports hook(s) to the current char
         -x <category> - Imports hook(s) to the current custom profile
                            <category>
         -d <prof>     - Imports hook(s) to the profile named <prof>
