azm / addzonemap              Adds a new zonemap
 
   Format:
      ;azm <name>             Adds a new zonemap
 
   Notes:
      Zonemaps are a plan for arranging windows on a workspace grid. Zonemaps
         contain one or more zone models, describing a region of the workspace 
         and the kinds of window that region is allowed to contain.
      Axmud provides a number of standard zonemaps, but you can create a new
         zonemap with this command.
      <name> must be no longer than 16 characters, and contain only A-Z, a-z, 
         underlines and 0-9 (not the first character).
 
   User commands:
      azm / addzm / addzonemap
