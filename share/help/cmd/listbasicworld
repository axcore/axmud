lbw / listbasicworld          Displays the basic mudlist
 
   Format:
      ;lbw                    Displays the list

   Notes:
      Axmud comes with a set of pre-configured worlds. It also comes with a much
         larger list of worlds which must be configured by the user. This basic
         mudlist is visible in the Connections window and by using the command.
      The basic mudlist can't be modified (other than by editing the original
         file), so it may include worlds for which you have since created a 
         world profile. (Those worlds are marked with a + sign.)
 
   User commands:
      lbw / listbasic / listbasicworld
