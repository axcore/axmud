ldi / listdirection           Lists primary/secondary directions

   Format:
      ;ldi                    Lists directions

   Notes:
      Axmud provides eighteen 'standard' primary directions - the sixteen
         compass directions (including 'north', 'northeast' and
         'northnortheast') as well as 'up' and 'down'. This standard set never
         changes.
      Axmud dictionaries store a custom set of primary directions, one for each
         standard direction. Dictionaries also store a set of secondary
         directions such as 'out' and 'in', this set can contain as many or as
         few directions as you want.
      A few worlds use a set of relative directions which depend on the
         direction of movement (see the help for ';addrelative').
      This command lists all primary, secondary and relative directions stored
         in the current dictionary.

      See also the help for ';listautosecondary'.
