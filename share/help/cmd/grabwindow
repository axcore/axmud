gwn / grabwindow              Grabs an 'external' window onto a workspace grid
 
   Format:
      ;gwn <pattern>          
               Incorporates a window matching <pattern>
      ;gwn <pattern> -w <workspace>         
               Incorporates a window matching <pattern> onto the <workspace>

      ;gwn <pattern> -a       
               Incorporates all windows matching <pattern>
      ;gwn <pattern> -a -w <workspace>     
               Incorporates all windows matching <pattern> onto the <workspace>
 
   Notes:
      The workspace grid is an invisible grid, spanning the whole available
         workspace, on which Axmud tries to arrange its windows so that they 
         don't overlap (as far as possible). The grid is divided into zones 
         within which one or more windows are arranged. The 'blueprint' for 
         zones on a desktop is called a 'zonemap'. 
      Only 'grid' windows (including the 'main' window, task windows and the 
         automapper window) are arranged on the workspace grid. Temporary
         windows, including the object viewer window and all edit, preference,
         wizard and dialogue windows, are not affected.

      'external' windows are any window not created by Axmud. Sometimes it's
         convenient to place an 'external' window on one of Axmud's workspace
         grids so that it doesn't overlap Axmud windows (as far as possible).
         Use the ';banishwindow' command to remove it from the grid and restore
         it to its original size and position.

      <pattern> is a regex (Perl regular expression). It is used in a 
         case-insensitive pattern match (so both 'notepade' and 'Notepad' will
         grab the same window). If <pattern> contains spaces, it should be 
         enclosed by diamond brackets <...>, e.g.
         
            ';gwn <my window>'
            
      If <workspace> is not specified, the 'external' window is grabbed onto 
         the same workspace grid used by this session's 'main' window. A list of
         workspace numbers can be obtained with the ';listworkspace' command.

      Note that this command only works on X11-based window managers (so it
         definitely will not work on MS Windows).

   User commands:
      gwn / grabwin / grabwindow
