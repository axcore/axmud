spr / simulateprompt          Simulates a prompt received from the world

   Format:
      ;spr <prompt>           Simulates the <prompt>

   Notes:
      This command allows you to simulate the current world by 'inserting' a
         prompt; Axmud will behave exactly as if the prompt had been received
         from the world. It's a convenient way to test tasks, Axbasic scripts,
         missions and triggers without interrupting the world itself.

      To preserve spacing, enclose the prompt in diamond brackets <...>

         e.g. ;simulateworld <Tell me your    name>

      To simulate a multi-line prompt, use '\n' for each newline character

         e.g. ;simulateworld <Listen!\nTell me your name>

      If your <prompt> ends with a newline character, it is removed.

      See also the help for ';simulateworld', which inserts some text that isn't
         a prompt, adding a newline character automatically.
