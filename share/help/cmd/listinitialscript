lis / listinitialscript       Lists initial scripts

   Format:
      ;lis
               Lists the global initial scriptlist
      ;lis <profile>
               Lists the <profile>'s initial scriptlist
      ;lis -c
               Lists everything in all current profiles' initial scriptlists
      ;lis -a
               Lists everything in all profiles' initial scriptlists

   Notes:
      Initial scripts are started when Axmud marks the current character as
         logged in (you can use the ';login' command to override the automatic
         process, if necessary), or when the user changes a current profile with
         commands like ';setworld' and ';setchar'.
      There are two types of initial scriptlist - one 'global' list which
         contains a list of scripts which apply to every world, and a separate
         set of initial scriptlists stored in each profile.
      See the help for ';addinitialscript' for more information about initial
         scripts.

   User commands:
      lis / listinitscript / listinitialscript
