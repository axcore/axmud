sdy / setdictionary           Sets the current dictionary for this session
 
   Format:
      ;sdy <name>
               Sets the current dictionary to <name>
      ;sdy <name> <language>
               Adds a new current dictionary <name> using <language>
   Notes:
      Dictionaries help Axmud to interpret the text it receives from the world.
      An Axmud dictionary stores groups of words. It contains a group of weapon
         words ('sword', 'mace', etc), a group of words for living beings
         ('orc', 'dwarf', etc), and several more besides.
      It also contains several useful terms, such as phrases for times of the
         day.

      This command sets the dictionary used in this session by the current
         world profile.
      If the dictionary <name> doesn't already exist, it is created.
      If a dictionary called <name> already exists and <language> is specified, 
         an error message is displayed - the language of an existing dictionary
         can't be changed with this command (use ';setlanguage' instead).

      If you want to create multiple dictionaries using another language, use
         ';adddictionary <name> <new_language>', change the default settings for
         that language, and then use ';clonedictionary' to create individual 
         dictionaries with the same language and initial settings.
      Dictionary names must be no longer than 16 characters, contain only A-Z, 
         a-z, underlines and 0-9 (not the first character) and not be one of 
         Axmud's reserved names (see the ';listreserved' command). The same
         restriction applies to the language. Non-Latin alphabets are
         acceptable.
