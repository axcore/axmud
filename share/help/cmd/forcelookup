flu / forcelookup             Re-fetches the user's IP address

   Format:
      ;flu                    Fetches your IP

   Notes:
      Some parts of the code need to know your IP address (for example, the Chat
         task, and the MNES protocol). Axmud does this by contacting some IP
         lookup servers.
      In case there is a delay in contacting the servers, this usually only
         happens once, and even then only when the IP address is actually
         needed.
      If you change your IP address while Axmud is running, you can use this
         command to force Axmud to fetch the new one.
      See also the help for ';setuplookup', ';resetlookup' and ';listlookup'.
