   Notes:
      Winmaps are a plan for arranging the layout of 'internal' windows 
         (consisting of all 'main' windows, 'protocol' windows such as those 
         created by MXP, and 'custom' windows such as task windows; see the help
         for ';addwinmap' for more details).
      The winmap consists of two parts: a list of strip objects, and a list of
         table objects (use the ';listwindow' command to get a list of 'grid' 
         window numbers.

      This command opens an 'edit' window for table object number <table> in 
         'grid' window number <window>.
