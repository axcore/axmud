cuw / collectunknownwords     Toggles collection of unrecognised words
 
   Format:
      ;cuw                    Toggles word collection on/off
 
   Notes:
      Axmud dictionaries contain lists of words, classified according to their
         type; this helps Axmud to interpret text received from the world.
      Whenever a line containing a list of objects is parsed, any words which
         aren't recognised by the current dictionary can be stored there in a
         special collection. 
      When you're ready to start adding new words to the dictionary (using the 
         ';addword' command), you can use the ';listunknownwords' command to 
         display a convenient list of all the words Axmud hasn't been able to 
         parse.
      This command starts or stops the collection of unrecognised words.
