scr / scrolllock              Toggles scroll lock mode in the 'main' window
 
   Format:
      ;scr                    Toggles scroll lock mode
 
   Notes:
      Scroll lock mode is on by default, and causes the 'main' window to scroll 
         to the bottom whenever new text is received from the world (or whenever
         a system message is displayed).
      If you're trying to read a help file, it might be convenient to turn off
         scroll lock mode for a while, so that you don't lose your place every
         time the world sends some text.

      The 'main' window typically includes some buttons next to the command
         entry box. The padlock button toggles scroll lock mode. If the window
         has multiple panes, the 'switch active pane' button next can switch 
         between them; the scroll lock is then toggled on the active pane.
      See also the help for the ';splitscreen' command.
