i / interact                  Interacts with target(s) in the current room

   Format:
      ;i                      Interacts with the first NPC in the room
      ;i <target>             Interacts with a single <target>
      ;i <target_list>        Interacts with the whole <target_list>

   Notes:
      Interactions are a form of attack usually involving guild skills. Whereas
         a fighter will usually try to 'kill' targets, a thief might try to
         'backstab' a target or a wizard might try to 'fry' a target.
      ';interact' interacts with the first target in the room suggested by the
         Locator. Axmud uses the 'interact' command specified by the current
         world's command cages. For most pre-configured worlds, this command is
         not set. You should update the command cages to use a verb like
         'backstab' or 'fry' before using this command.

      <target> must be a singular noun or adjective. To interact with a 'big
         guard', you can use the command ';interact guard' or ';interact big';
         but you can't use the command ';interact guards'.
      However, <target> can be the words 'all' or 'mall' (or the equivalent in
          the current world). 'all' normally means all creatures except your
          character (and any minions your character controls). 'mall' normally
          means every being that's not a player character (PC).

      <target_list> should be a list of singular nouns and adjectives. To
         interact with 'a big guard and a hairy orc', you could use the commands
         ';interact guard orc', ';interact big hairy', ';interact guard hairy'
         or ';interact big orc'.
      One interaction will be launched for every noun or adjective in
         <target_list>. The commands ';interact guard guard orc' and
         ';interact big big hairy' will both interact with exactly two big
         guards and one hairy orc, regardless of how many guards, orcs, big
         things or hairy things there are in the room.

      'all' overrides every other <target>, and 'mall' overrides every target
         except 'all'. So, the command ';interact gandalf mall' will interact
         with all NPCs in the room, but it won't interact with a player-
         controlled character called Gandalf.
      ';interact' can only be used to interact with things Axmud knows to be a
         character, minion, sentient or creature. You can't ';interact door',
         even if the world allows you to 'cast spell on door' as a way of
         breaking down a door; you can't use ';interact bear' if Axmud doesn't
         know that 'bear' is a living being.
       If you don't specify a <target> at all, this command will attack the
         first NPC, ignoring any player characters in the room. If you specify a
         target, it can be either a player or non-player character.
