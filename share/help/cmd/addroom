arm / addroom                 Adds a room to the world model

   Format:
      ;arm <region> <x> <y> <z>
               Adds a new room

   Notes:
      The world model stores information about the regions, rooms, characters
         and objects in the game world. The automapper window uses the model to
         display its maps.
      Most model objects can be added with ';addmodelobject', but rooms must be
         added with this command.

      <region> is the name of the region in which the room is added, and <x>,
         <y> and <z> are the coordinates of the new room's position in the
         regionmap.
      Rooms can't be added to a portion of the regionmap that is already
         occupied by another room. Unless you know exactly where you want to put
         a room, it's usually easier to create it in the automapper window.

   User commands:
      arm / addroom
