awk / addspeedwalk            Adds a speedwalk character
 
   Format:
      ;awk <char> <cmd>       Adds a speedwalk <char> for a movement <cmd>
      
   Notes:
      Speedwalking is a method of moving from one location in the world to
         another with a minimum of typing.
      Speedwalk commands can be typed in the 'main' window's command entry box.
         These commands start with the speedwalk sigil, a full stop/period
         character:
      
         .3ne2s
   
      ...which is the equivalent of typing 'north;north;north;east;south;south'.
         See the help for ';speedwalk' for a full explanation of Axmud's
         speedwalking capabilities.
      
      In the example above, the speedwalk characters 'n', 'e' and 's' represent
         the movement commands 'north', 'east' and 'south'
      This command can be used to add a new speedwalk character to the current
         dictionary (or to modify an existing one). 
      <char> can be any letter in the range a-z. 
      <cmd> should be a movement command. Any type of movement command can be
         added (e.g. 'enter', 'exit', 'portal'). If the movement command
         contains spaces, it should be surrounded by diamond brackets:
         
         ;addspeedwalk x <enter portal>
         
      If <cmd> is a standard primary direction ('north', 'northeast', 
         'northnortheast', etc, as well as 'up' and 'down'), it is converted
         into the corresponding custom primary direction when it's used. The
         default English-language dictionary creates this output:
         
         .3ne2s         > north;north;north;east;south;south

      But a French-language dictionary might create this output:
      
         .3ne2s         > nord;nord;nord;est;sud;sud
         
      ...and, in that case, there would be no need to modify the default set of 
         speedwalk characters using this command.
