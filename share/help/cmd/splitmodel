smd / splitmodel              Sets hows Axmud stores large world models

   Format:
      ;smd                    Show current settings

      ;smd on                 Enable multiple data files
      ;smd off                Disable multiple data files

      ;smd -d                 Use default data file size
      ;smd <size>             Set data file size

   Notes:
      Traditionally, the world model (which handles all maps) stores its data in
         a single data file. However, users who created large world models on
         computers with limited memory often experienced an 'out of memory'
         error.
      To alleviate this problem, Axmud now stores the world model across
         several files, which can be loaded into memory one at a time, greatly
         reducing the risk of an 'out of memory error'.
      You can disable this functionality with ';smd off', which forces Axmud to
         store the world model in a single data file.
      By default, Axmud now applies a limit of 5000 objects (regions, rooms,
         weapons, creatures) per file. You can change this setting with the
         -d or <size> options.
      <size>, if used, must be an integer, 1000 or more.
