prd / permread                Tells an initial task to read something aloud
 
   Format:
      ;prd <attribute>
      ;prd <attribute> <value>
                              Tells a task to read something aloud

      ;prd                    Get a list of available <attribute>s
 
   Notes:
      Tasks have various text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities, but some tasks don't
         use TTS at all. The ';read', ';switch' and ';alert' commands allow you 
         to interact with the TTS capabilities of currently-running tasks. 
      The ';permread', ';permswitch' and ';permalert' commands allow you to 
         interact with the TTS capabilities of tasks in the global initial
         tasklist - the tasks which start, every time you connect to a world - 
         as well as any currently-running tasks.
      To modify the way that tasks process speech in general, use the ';speech'
         and ';editconfig' commands. TTS for tasks is turned off, by default, so
         you won't hear anything until you turn it on with the ';speech' 
         command.

      The ';read' and ';permread' commands are both in the same format:
 
         ;read <attribute> <value>
         ;permread <attribute> <value>

      For example, both ';read description 100' and ';permread description 100'
         will instruct the current Locator task to read the first 100 
         characters of the current room's description.
      In some cases, a task might want to store the <value> you specify. ';read' 
         will store the value in the current Locator task; ';permread' will 
         store the value there, and in the Locator task stored in the global
         initial tasklist (if any). In other words, ';read' affects the current
         session, but ';permread' affects this and all future sessions.
      
      Note that none of Axmud's built-in tasks store the <value> from this 
         command. You will probably never use ';permread', but you might use
         ';permswitch' and ';permalert' a lot.
      If you don't specify an <attribute> at all, a list of available attributes
         will be displayed. See the help for ';read' for a full list of 
         attributes used with Axmud's built-in tasks.
