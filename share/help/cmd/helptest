hpt / helptest                Tests Axmud help files

   Format:
      ;hpt                    Tests all help files

   Notes:
      This is a debugging command which tests whether the format of Axmud's help
         files is correct. In particular, it checks that each file doesn't
         contain any lines longer than an 80 character limit.
      The help files use the default set of user commands. If you have added or
         removed any of them (using ';addusercommand' or ';deleteusercommand),
         this command will flag up a possible error.

   User commands:
      hpt / testhelp / helptest
