cs / checkscript              Checks an Axbasic script
 
   Format:
      ;cs                     Checks the script in the file test.bas
      ;cs <script>            Checks the script in the file <script>.bas
 
   Notes:
      Axbasic is Axmud's own scripting language, based on the original Dartmouth
         BASIC and the later implementation by the same authors, True BASIC.
      As well as standard BASIC keywords and intrinsic (built-in) functions,
         Axbasic provides a number of keywords and functions especially designed
         to interact with the world and with Axmud's stored data. Use the 
         ';axbasichelp' command for a list of keywords and functions.

      This command tests the syntax of an Axbasic script by performing the
         preliminary parsing stage. It's a useful way of checking your scripts
         for obvious errors without actually having to run them.

      When Axmud wants to load an Axbasic script, it checks a list of 
         directories (called 'folders' on MS Windows systems), one at a time, 
         until it finds a script with the right name. The first directory in the 
         list is always the standard 'scripts' sub-directory, but the rest of 
         the list is customisable (see the help for ';adddirectory'). 
      <script> should match the name of at least one file in these directories
         (without their .bas extensions).
