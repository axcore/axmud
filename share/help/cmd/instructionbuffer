ib / instructionbuffer        Shows the status of an instruction buffer
 
   Format:
      ;ib -s                  Shows session's buffer status
      ;ib                     

      ;ib -c                  Shows status of client's combined buffer 

   Notes:
      Instruction buffers are Axmud's records of processed instructions. An
         instruction includes everything you type in the 'main' window - a 
         client command like ';setworld deathmud' is an instruction, as is a 
         world  command such as 'north'.
      Several world commands typed together such as 'north;kill orc;eat corpse'
         also count as a single instruction (but they are stored as three
         separate commands in the world command buffers.)
      Various parts of the code can generate their own world commands and their
         own client commands, which are again stored as instructions in these 
         buffers.

      Every session has its own instruction buffer, storing instructions 
         processed by that session. There is also a combined instruction buffer
         storing instructions processed by all sessions.

      Each instruction has its own entry, or 'item', in the buffer. The number 
         of the items in the combined buffer and session buffers won't match if
         there is more than one session open.
      This command shows basic information about one of the buffers. To show the
         buffer's contents, use the ';dumpinstructionbuffer' command.

   User commands:
      ib / instructbuff / instructionbuffer
