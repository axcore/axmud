mcp / mcp                     Shows supported MCP packages

   Format:
      ;mcp                    Shows all MCP packages

   Notes:
      The world can use the MCP protocol to send extra information about the
         game state.
      Axmud provides three MCP packages (mcp-negotiate, mcp-cord and
            dns-org-mud-moo-simpleedit).
      Additional MCP packages are created by plugins. Axmud comes with a plugin,
         'zmptest.pm', which demonstrates how this is done. It needs to be
         loaded before you connect to a world, so you should usually connect to
         any world in 'offline' mode, and then type:

            ;addinitialplugin -s
            ;save

      This command lists all the ZMP packages that Axmud supports, or that have
         been added by a loaded plugin.

   User commands:
      mcp
