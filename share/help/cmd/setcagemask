smk / setcagemask             Manages cage masks
 
   Format:
      ;smk <type> <switch> -a <iv> <data>
               Sets the instance variable <iv> with <data>
      ;smk <type> <switch> -u <iv>
               Unsets the instance variable <iv>
      ;smk <type> <switch> -l
               Displays the specified mask
      ;smk <type> <switch> -n <task_name>
               Applies the specified mask now
 
   Notes:
      Cage masks are a way of initialising (or resetting) a task's settings and
         parameters depending on which profiles are current profiles. Axmud's
         code does not contain any cage masks at the moment, though it may in 
         the future.

      <type> is the cage mask type. 
      <switch> is a switch option specifying which cage mask to modify. If 
         <switch> is not specified, the lowest-priority mask (associated with 
         the world profile) is modified.
      <switch> can be one of the following options:
         -w   Modifies the mask associated with the current world
         -g   Modifies the mask associated with the current guild         
         -r   Modifies the mask associated with the current race
         -c   Modifies the mask associated with the current char
         -x <category>
              Modifies the mask associated with the current custom profile
                 <category>
         -d <prof>
              Modifies the mask associated with the profile <prof>
 
      <data> can be a scalar variable, a list, or a hash.
      If <data> is a scalar and contains a space, the scalar must be enclosed
         within diamond brackets <...>
      If <data> is a list or hash, each element that contains a space must also
         be enclosed within diamond brackets.
       
      The mask is usually applied to a task by the task itself. To apply the 
         mask manually, use the '-n' switch and specify the name of a task in 
         the current tasklist. (This is a debugging tool which is probably not 
         advisable).
