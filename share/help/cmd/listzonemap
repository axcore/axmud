lzm / listzonemap             Lists all zonemaps
 
   Format:
      ;lzm                    Lists zonemaps
      ;lzm -s                 Lists only standard zonemaps
 
   Notes:
      Zonemaps are a plan for arranging windows on a workspace grid. Zonemaps
         contain one or more zone models, describing a region of the workspace 
         and the kinds of window that region is allowed to contain.
      Axmud provides a number of standard zonemaps, but you can create a new
         zonemap with the ';addzonemap' command.
      This list shows how many zone models each zonemap contains, and whether
         the zonemap is full, or not. Zonemaps which are the default zonemap for
         a particular workspace are marked with a 'D'. Zonemaps which are
         currently in use by a workspace grid are marked with with an asterisk. 
      Axmud occasionally creates temporary zonemaps (for example, when handling
         certain MXP requests); these zonemaps are automatically deleted when 
         the session terminates.
