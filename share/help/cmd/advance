adv / advance                 Advance the current character's guild skills
 
   Format:
      ;adv                    Advances the next skill
      ;adv <number>           Advances the next <number> of skills
      ;adv -a                 Advances as many skills as possible
 
      ;adv -s <skill>         Advances the specified <skill>
      ;adv -s <skill> <number>
                              Advances the specified <skill>, <number> times
      ;adv -s <skill> -a      Advances the specified <skill> as much as possible
 
   Notes:
      The Advance task can be used to advance (improve) the current character's
         guild skills. The task is automatically started when this command is
         used. Once the advancement process is complete, the task automatically 
         halts.
      A list of skills to advance, and the order in which to advance them, is
         stored in each guild profile. From there, it is imported into each new
         character profile (use the ';resetguildskills' command to re-import the 
         current guild's list into the current character).
      If -s is not specified, the first skill (or skills) in the list is
         advanced. If it's not possible to advance a skill (maybe because the
         character doesn't have enough XP or cash), it is retained in the list
         and re-used the next time this command is executed; otherwise it is
         removed from the list.
      If -s is specified, the named <skill> is advanced. The character's skill
         lists are ignored.
      You can specify '-s <skill> <number>' several times in the same command:
         the Advance task will process them all in the specified order.
         
            e.g. ';advance -s fighting -s dodging 5 -s hiding -a
