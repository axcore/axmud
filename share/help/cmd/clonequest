cqs / clonequest              Clones an existing quest

   Format:
      ;cqs <original> <copy>
               Clones the <original> quest into one named <copy>
 
   Notes:
      Axmud is able to store information about the current world's quests. This 
         command clones a new quest using the contents of an existing one.
      Quests are stored in the current world profile. Quest names must be no
         longer than 16 characters, contain only A-Z, a-z, underlines and 0-9 
         (not the first character) and not be one of Axmud's reserved names (see 
         the ';listreserved' command).
      See the help for ';addquest' for more information about quests.
