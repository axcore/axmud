achp / addchannelpattern      Adds a Channels/Divert task pattern

   Format:
      ;achp <channel> <pattern>
      ;achp -g <channel> <pattern>
               Adds a pattern gagged in the 'main' window

      ;achp -m <channel> <pattern>
               Adds a pattern not gagged in the 'main' window

      ;achp -e <pattern>
               Adds an exception pattern
 
   Notes:
      The Channels and Divert tasks intercept text received from the world and
         divert that text into their own task window. Sometimes the text is
         gagged, meaning that it's displayed in the 'main' window too. You can't
         run both tasks at the same time.
      The world profile stores a list of patterns. When a line of text which
         matches one of those patterns is received, it is diverted to the task
         window.
         
      Each pattern is also assigned a channel.      
      In the Channels task window, each channel has its own tab. You might have
         a 'tell' channel for tell messages like 'Gandalf tells you...' and a
         'social' channel for lines like 'Bilbo shouts, I'm leaving now!'.
      You can use the task's 'edit' window to set which, if any, tabs should be
         opened automatically when the task starts.
         
      In the Divert task window there is a single tab. The window's background
         colour briefly changes when text is diverted, indicating which channel
         the pattern is assigned to.
      You can specify as many patterns as you like, and as many channels as you
         like. The Divert task traditionally uses channels called 'tell',
         'social', 'custom' and 'warning', and each of those channels has an
         identifiable background colour. There's a separate background colour
         shared by all other channels.

      The world profile stores a separate list of exception patterns. When a
         line of text is received that matches both a normal pattern and an
         exception pattern, it is not diverted.
      For example, if you want to see 'Gandalf tells you' and 'Bilbo tells you',
         but not 'The shopkeeper tells you', you could add the pattern
         'tells you' and the exception pattern 'shopkeeper tells you'.

      <channel> can contain any characters, but must be 1-16 characters in
         length. <pattern> is a Perl regular expression.
      If either <channel> or <pattern> contain spaces, they should be enclosed
         within diamond brackets <...>
