lms / listminionstring        Lists minion strings stored in the world model

   Format:
      ;lms                    Lists minion strings

   Notes:
      The world model stores information about the regions, rooms, characters
         and objects in the game world. The automapper window uses the model to
         display its maps.
      The world model can also keep track of minions - non-player characters
         which are controlled directly by players.

      Minion objects are treated a little differently to other model objects.
         The world model stores a collection of strings which the world uses to
         describe a minion. The world might use more than one string for the
         same minion and some strings are independent of any specific minion
         (see the help for ';addminionstring' for more information).
      This command lists all minion strings and their corresponding model
         objects (if any).
