dsc / deletestatuscommand     Deletes a command from those sent by Status task

   Format:
      ;dsc <cmd>              Deletes a Status task command

   Notes:
      In 'active' mode, the Status task sends commands to the world every few
         seconds (usually commands like 'score', 'sc' and 'time') to keep the
         task's statistics up to date.
      <cmd> is the command to delete. If <cmd> contains spaces, you must
         surround it with diamond brackets, e.g. <go north>
      This command can only be used when the Status task is in 'disactivated'
         mode. Use ';disactivatestatustask' to disactivate the task.

   User commands:
      dsc / delstatuscommand / deletestatuscommand
