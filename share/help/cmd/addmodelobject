amo / addmodelobject          Adds an object to the world model

   Format:
      ;amo <type> <name>
               Adds an object called <name>
      ;amo <type> <name> <num>
               Adds an object as a child of the existing object number <num>

   Notes:
      The world model stores information about the regions, rooms, characters
         and objects in the game world. The automapper window uses the
         information stored in the world model to draw its maps.
      Most model objects can be added with this command, but regions must be
         added with ';addregion', rooms must be added with ';addroom' and exits
         can be added to the exit model with 'addexit'.

      <type> must be one of the following switches:
         -w weapon, -a armour, -g garment, -c character, -m minion, -s sentient,
         -k creature, -p portable, -d decoration, -u custom model object
      <name> is the name assigned to the object. If it contains spaces, you can
         enclose the name with diamond brackets, e.g. '<big axe>'
      If <num> is specified, it must be the number of an existing model object.
         <num> will be the 'parent' of the new object.
      If the parent is a room, the object will be considered as part of the
         room. If the parent is a different kind of object, the new object will
         be considered as 'inside' the parent. If the object has no specified
         location, it can be given a region object as a parent, or even have no
         parent at all.

      World model objects all have a unique number. They are identified by that
         number, not by their name, so multiple objects can have the same
         <name>. However, all character objects (and regions) must have a unique
         name. If <name> is longer than 32 characters, it will be abbreviated.
