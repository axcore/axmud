lfv / listfavouriteworld      Shows the list of favourite worlds
 
   Format:
      ;lfv                    Shows the list
 
   Notes:
      Axmud's connections window displays a list of world profiles, sorted in
         order of frequency, with the most-visited world highest on the list.
      However, you can specify one or more 'favourite worlds' which are
         automatically promoted to the top of the list. The first world in the
         list is automatically selected, which means you can connect to the 
         world with a single keypress.
      This command shows the list of favourite worlds. You can set the list with
         the ';setfavouriteworld' command.

   User commands:
