stc / stopclient              Stops the client and saves files

   Format:
      ;stc                    Stops the client
      ;stc -s                 Saves files, then stops the client

   Notes:
      Use this command to stop the client quickly. If there are any unsaved
         files, you'll be asked whether you want to save them first (unless
         you specified the -s switch).
      To stop the client immediately, without saving files, use the ';panic'
         command.

   User commands:
      stc / stopclient
