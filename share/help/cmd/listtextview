ltv / listtextview            Lists textview objects
 
   Format:
      ;ltv                    Lists textview objects
 
   Notes:
      A textview is a scrolling area of a window where text is displayed. A
         textview object is an Axmud component which handles these areas
         intelligently.
      This command (which is probably only of use to Axmud developers) lists all
         textview objects and their properties.

   User commands:
      ltv / listtv / listtextview
