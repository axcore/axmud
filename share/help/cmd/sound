snd / sound                   Turns sound on/off

   Format:
      ;snd on                 Turns sound on
      ;snd off                Turns sound off
      ;snd                    Shows whether sound is on or off

   Notes:
      This command turns sound on and off. ';sound on' will fail if no external
         audio package has been specified (with the ';setexternalprogramme'
         command).

      Sound typically comes from two sources - Axmud sound effects, and sounds
         requested by the world itself.

      Axmud provides two groups of sound effects by default. The first group are
         used by various parts of the Axmud code, and are named for the purpose
         for which they're mostly used:
         afk      - Text received from the world after using ;awayfromkeys
         alarm    - General alarm
         attack   - General attack started
         beep     - Old-fashioned beep
         bell     - Desk bell
         call     - Incoming chat message
         death    - Character dies
         deposit  - Character deposits money into bank
         error    - System error/warning/debug/improper arguments messages
         greeting - General arrival
         kill     - General kill
         lost     - Automapper gets lost
         notify   - General notification
         ready    - Something is ready
         torch    - Torch has burnt out
         withdraw - Character withdraws money from bank
      The second group of sound effects are named after the sounds they use
         ('computer', 'gorilla', 'mosquito' etc).
      Axmud's 'sound effects bank' consists of sound effects from both banks,
         and can be customised by the user to add or remove sound effects.

      If the world supports the Mud Sound Protocol (MSP), it can request that
         Axmud downloads and plays sounds directly from the world. See the
         ';msp' command for more information.
      MSP sounds won't be audible if sound has been turned off using this
         command.
