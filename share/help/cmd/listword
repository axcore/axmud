lwd / listword                Lists words and terms from the current dictionary
 
   Format:
      ;lwd <switches>         Lists words and terms
 
   Notes:
      Dictionaries help Axmud to interpret the text it receives from the world.
      An Axmud dictionary stores groups of words. It contains a group of weapon
         words ('sword', 'mace', etc), a group of words for living beings
         ('orc', 'dwarf', etc), and several more besides.
      It also contains several useful terms, such as phrases for times of the
         day.

      This command lists groups of words from the current dictionary. <switches> 
         should be one or more of the following switch options:
 
      -z     - Lists everything
 
      -g     - Lists guilds
      -r     - Lists races
      -w     - Lists weapons
      -a     - Lists armours
      -e     - Lists garments
      -s     - Lists sentient beings
      -k     - Lists creatures

      -q     - Lists portable types
      -d     - Lists decorations
      -u     - Lists decoration types
      -l     - Lists plural words
      -x     - Lists pseudo-nouns
 
      -j     - Lists adjectives
      -c     - Lists declined adjectives
      -y     - Lists pseudo-adjectives
      -v     - Lists pseudo-object strings
      -i     - Lists ignore words (not nouns or adjectives)

      -b     - Lists time of day phrases
      -f     - Lists clock hour phrases
      -m     - Lists clock minute phrases
 
      Switch options can be combined in a single command:
      
         e.g. ';listword -j -c -y'
         
      This command can't display the current dictionary's list of unrecognised
         words (use the ';listunknownwords' command for that).
