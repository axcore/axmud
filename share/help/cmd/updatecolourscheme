ucs / updatecolourscheme      Updates 'internal' windows using a colour scheme

   Format:
      ;ucs <name>             Updates windows using the colour scheme <name>

   Notes:
      A textview is a scrolling area of a window where text is displayed. A
         colour scheme determines the colours and font used in the textview.
      Axmud provides a standard set of colour schemes, one for each window type.

      Colour schemes can be modified with the ';modifycolourscheme' command, but
         any changes are not automatically applied to all windows. Usually,
         colour schemes are used when a window is created or re-drawn.
      Window panes (areas of an 'internal' window, containing textviews) are an
         exception. After modifying a colour scheme, you can use this command to
         update all window panes that use it.

   User commands:
      ucs / updatescheme / updatecolorscheme / updatecolourscheme
