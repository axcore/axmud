cwm / clonewinmap             Clones a winmap
 
   Format:
      ;cwm <old> <new>
               Clones the winmap <old> into one named <new>
 
   Notes:
      Winmaps are a plan for arranging the layout of 'internal' windows 
         (consisting of all 'main' windows, 'protocol' windows such as those 
         created by MXP, and 'custom' windows such as task windows).
      See the help for ';addwinmap' for more information about winmaps.

      Axmud provides a number of standard winmaps which can't be modified or
         deleted. (This guarantees, for example, that task windows which want a
         uniform layout can have one).
      Although standard winmaps can't be modified, you can clone them using this
         command, and then modify the clone using commands like ';modifywinmap',
         ';addwinzone' and so on.
      <new> must be no longer than 16 characters, and contain only A-Z, a-z, 
         underlines and 0-9 (not the first character). Non-Latin alphabets are
         acceptable.

   User commands:
