dzl / deletezonemodel         Deletes a zone model

   Format:
      ;dzl <name> <number>
               Deletes the zone model <number> from the zonemap <name>

   Notes:
      Zonemaps are a plan for arranging windows on a workspace grid. Zonemaps
         contain one or more zone models, describing a region of the workspace
         and the kinds of window that region is allowed to contain.
      For a list of zonemaps, use the ';listzonemap' command.

      ';deletezonemodel' can be used on a zonemap currently in use by a
         workspace grid, but the changes won't be applied until the grid is
         reset (using ';resetgrid').

   User commands:
      dzl / delzl / deletezl / deletezonemodel
