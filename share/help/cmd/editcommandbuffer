ecb / editcommandbuffer       Opens an 'edit' window for a command buffer item

   Format:
      ;ecb -s <number>        Edits the session buffer item <number>
      ;ecb <number>
      ;ecb -s                 Edits the most recent session buffer item
      ;ecb

   Notes:
      World command buffers are Axmud's records of individual commands sent to
         the world (see the help for ';commandbuffer').
      Every session has its own world command buffer, storing world commands
         sent by that session. There is also a combined world command buffer
         storing world commands sent by all sessions.

   User commands:
      ecb / editcmdbuff / editcommandbuffer
