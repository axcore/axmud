eit / editinitialtask         Opens an 'edit' window for an initial task

   Format:
      ;eit <task>
               Edits the <task> in the global initial tasklist
      ;eit <task> <profile>
               Edits the <task> in the <profile>'s initial tasklist

   Notes:
      Initial tasks are started when Axmud marks the current character as logged
         in (you can use the ';login' command to override the automatic process,
         if necessary), or when the user changes a current profile with commands
         like ';setworld' and ';setchar'.
      There are two types of initial tasklist - one 'global' list which contains
         a list of tasks which apply to every world, and a separate set of
         initial tasklists stored in each profile.
      When a current profile changes, any tasks that were created from the old
         profile's initial tasklist are halted before the new current profile's
         initial tasks are started.

      <task> can be any Axmud built-in or external task.
      <task> can be in the form of a task's label (e.g. 'stat', 'status') or its
          formal name (e.g. 'status_task').
      (Use the ';listtasklabel' command to list all task labels.)

   User commands:
      eit / editinittask / editinitialtask
