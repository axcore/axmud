aex / addexit                 Adds an exit to the exit model

   Format:
      ;aex <direction> <room>
               Adds an exit in <direction> belonging to <room>
 
   Notes:
      The world model stores information about the regions, rooms, characters
         and objects in the game world. The automapper window uses the model to
         display its maps.
      Most model objects can be added with ';addmodelobject', but exits must be
         added to the exit model with this command.

      <direction> is the nominal direction of the exit: 'north', 'n', 'portal'
         and so on. <direction> must be no longer than 32 characters.
      <room> is the number of a room object in the world model. A valid room
         number must be specified.
