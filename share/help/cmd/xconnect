xcn / xconnect                Reconnects to the same world without saving files
 
   Format:
      ;xcn                    Reconnects to the world
      ;xcn -o                 Reconnects to the world in 'offline' mode
 
   Notes:
      This command reconnects to the same world, first terminating the current
         connection (if there is one) but without saving data files. The
         connection opens in a new 'main' window (or in a new tab in a shared
         'main' window).
      If there is a current character profile, it is re-used. If that 
         character's password is known, automatic logins can take place.
      In offline mode, Axmud simulates a connection to the world; some client
         commands will be available, but others will not.
      Use the ';reconnect' command to save files before reconnecting.
 
   User commands:
