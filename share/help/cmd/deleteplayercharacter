dpc / deleteplayercharacter   Deletes a player character (PC) from the model

   Format:
      ;dpc <name>             Deletes the PC <name>

   Notes:
      The world model stores information about the regions, rooms, characters
         and objects in the game world. The automapper window uses the model to
         display its maps.
      Most model objects can be deleted with ';deletemodelobject', including
         player characters (model objects which represent a character in the
         world). Player characters can also be deleted from the model using
         this command.
