layer / setlayer              Sets the session's workspace grid layer

   Format:
      ;layer <number>         Sets the current layer to <number>
      ;layer                  Displays current layers

   Notes:
      The workspace grid is an invisible grid, spanning the whole available
         workspace, on which Axmud tries to arrange its windows so that they
         don't overlap (as far as possible). The grid is divided into zones
         within which one or more windows are arranged. The 'blueprint' for
         zones on a desktop is called a 'zonemap'.
      Only 'grid' windows (including the 'main' window, task windows and the
         automapper window) are arranged on the workspace grid. Temporary
         windows, including the data viewer window and all edit, preference,
         wizard and dialogue windows, are not affected.
      The grid is divided into zones. When a window is created in a zone that
         doesn't have room for it, the window is moved up or down into a new
         'layer'. All windows in the current layer are visible, and some windows
         in lower layers may be visible, if there are no windows above them. All
         windows above the current layer are minimised from the desktop so that
         they're not visible at all.

      If <number> is specified, this command sets the current layer in all
         workspace grids used by this session. The default layer is the lowest
         one, layer 0.
      To move up or down a layer at a time, use the ';layerup' and
         ';layerdown' commands.

   User commands:
      layer / setlayer
