lp / listproperty             Lists a profile template's properties

   Format:
      ;lp <template>          Lists the <template>'s properties
      ;lp -r                  Lists reserved properties

   Notes:
      The blueprint for a new category of profile is called a profile template.
         Several custom profiles can be based on a single template.
      This command lists all of the properties of the blueprint (a property can
         be used interchangeably with the terms 'instance variable' and 'IV').
      If the switch '-r' is specified instead, a list of the reserved properties
         (those which are the same for all custom profiles and which can't be
         modified on the parent template) is displayed.
      (See the help for ';listprofile' for more information about profiles.)
