eib / editinstructionbuffer   Opens 'edit' window for an instruction buffer item

   Format:
      ;eib -s <number>        Edits the session buffer item <number>
      ;eib <number>
      ;eib -s                 Edits the most recent session buffer item
      ;eib

      ;eib -c <number>        Edits the combined buffer item <number>
      ;eib -c                 Edits the most recent combined buffer item

   Notes:
      Instruction buffers are Axmud's records of processed instructions (see the
         help for ';instructionbuffer').
      Every session has its own instruction buffer, storing instructions
         processed by that session. There is also a combined instruction buffer
         storing instructions processed by all sessions.

   User commands:
      eib / editinstructbuff / editinstructionbuffer
