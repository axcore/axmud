ddr / deletedirectory         Stops using directory containing Axbasic scripts
 
   Format:
      ;ddr <number>           Stops using the directory <number>
 
   Notes:
      When Axmud wants to load an Axbasic script, it checks a list of 
         directories (called 'folders' on MS Windows systems), one at a time, 
         until it finds a script with the right name.
      The first directory in the list is always the standard 'scripts'
         sub-directory, but the rest of the list is customisable. You can use 
         the ';listdirectory' command to get a numbered list of directories, and
         then use this command to remove one of them.
      The standard directory can't be removed, so <number> must be at least 1.
         Of course, after removing a directory, the numbers of other directories
         will change, so you will need to consult ';listdirectory' each time you
         use this command.

   User commands:
      ddr / deldir / deletefolder / deletedirectory
