lwt / listwindowtable         Lists table objects in an 'internal' window

   Format:
      ;lwt <window>           Lists table objects

      ;lwt <window> -i        Lists table objects and initialisation settings
      ;lwt -i <window>

   Notes:
      Winmaps are a plan for arranging the layout of 'internal' windows
         (consisting of all 'main' windows, 'protocol' windows such as those
         created by MXP, and 'custom' windows such as task windows; see the help
         for ';addwinmap' for more details).
      The winmap consists of two parts: a list of strip objects, and a list of
         table objects (use the ';listwindow' command to get a list of 'grid'
         window numbers.

      This command lists table objects for 'grid' window number <window>. If the
         -i switch is specified, the table object's initialisation settings are
         displayed, too.

   User commands:
      lwt / listtable / listwindowtable
