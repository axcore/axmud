   Notes:
      Some worlds use protocols to exchange (negotiate) information which the
         client that can be used to improve the gaming experience. Axmud
         supports nine protocols.
      MSDP sends extra information about the character, such as their current
         health (hit) points. Some of this information is used to update the
         Status task (and, from there, the current character profile).
         Information about the character's current location, if sent, is used to
         update the Locator task. The information is available to your scripts,
         if they want it, and can be viewed with the ';showmsdp' command.
      ATCP and GMCP also send extra information about the world.
      MSSP sends information about the world's status, such as how many players
         are currently connected. This data is also available for your scripts
         and can be viewed with the ';showmssp' command.
      MCCP compresses data sent to and from the world.
      MSP, MXP, Pueblo, ZMP, AARD102 and MCP all serve to enhance the game
         experience in worlds that implement those protocols.
      MTTS exchanges some information about the enhanced features Axmud
         supports. MNES exchanges a smaller set of information about Axmud
         support for various features.

      In Axmud, all MUD protocols are enabled by default. You can use this
         command to disable them. The action applies to every existing
         connection (and future ones).
      Since Axmud negotiates MUD protocols passively, if you re-enable a MUD
         protocol after disabling it, the protocol will still be disabled in
         existing connections; the change will be applied to all future
         connections.
