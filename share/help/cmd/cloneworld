cwo / cloneworld              Clones a world profile

   Format:
      ;cwo <copy>
      ;cwo <copy> <switches>
               Clones the current world profile into one named <copy>

      ;cwo <original> <copy>
      ;cwo <original> <copy> <switches>
               Clones the world profile <original> into one named <copy>

   Notes:
      This operation clones not only the world, but all its associated guild,
         race, character and custom profiles, their cages, any associated
         profile templates, the world model and the current dictionary. However,
         only the world profile is stored in memory; everything else is saved
         directly to a data file (and won't be loaded into memory until you
         change the current world profile).

      If <original> is specified, it must be the current world profile for this
         session. (This syntax has been made available for consistency with
         other client commands.)
      Profile names must be no longer than 16 characters, contain only A-Z, a-z,
         underlines and 0-9 (not the first character) and not be one of Axmud's
         reserved names (see the ';listreserved' command). Non-Latin alphabets
         are acceptable.
      The operation will fail if a profile called <copy> already exists or if
         <copy> is an invalid name.

      If <switches> are specified, some associated items are not cloned.
      <switches> can be one or more of the following:
         -a   Clone the world profile, but not its associated profiles
         -t   ...but not any cages
         -k   ...but not any profile templates
         -m   ...but not the world model
         -d   ...but not the dictionary
         -e   Don't clone any of these items; just clone the world profile
      Multiple switches (including -e) can be used together in the same command.
