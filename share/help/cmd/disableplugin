dpl / disableplugin           Disables an Axmud plugin

   Format:
      ;dpl <name>             Disables the plugin <name>

   Notes:
      Axmud plugins are Perl modules which allow you to extend Axmud's core
         functionality with new tasks, client commands, cages, 'edit' windows
         and menu items, all of them integrating seemlessly with the existing
         Axmud code. (Strip and table objects defined by a plugin are always
         available, once the plugin is loaded.)
      This command disables a plugin. Any client commands it created become
         unavailable. Any tasks it added are halted immediately and cannot be
         re-started. Any menu items are desensitised any 'edit' windows can no
         longer be opened.
      The plugin can be re-enabled with the ';enableplugin' command, at which
         point its tasks, client commands, 'edit' windows and menu items will
         become available again.
      See the help for ';loadplugin' for more information about Axmud plugins.

   User commands:
