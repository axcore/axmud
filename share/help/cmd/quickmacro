qm / quickmacro               Creates a macro using the previous command

   Format:
      ;qm <keycode>           Creates a macro

   Notes:
      Macros are one of five types of Axmud interface (the others being
         triggers, aliases, timers and hooks).
      Macros allow you to specify instructions to be executed automatically when
         a certain key (or combination of keys) is pressed.

      This command behaves much like the ';addmacro' command, remembering
         whichever command you typed just before this one.
      You only need to specify which combination of keys causes the macro to
         'fire', executing that same command again.
      See the help ';addmacro', which gives some examples of a valid <keycode>,
         such as 'f5' or 'shift up'.

   User commands:
      qm / qmacro / quickmacro
