spp / setprofilepriority      Sets the profile priority list

   Format:
      ;spp <list>             Sets the profile priority list to <list>
      ;spp                    Resets the list to the default list

   Notes:
      Profiles are collections of data about worlds, guilds, races, characters
         and so on. Every Axmud session (every open tab in the 'main' window)
         always uses at least one profile - the 'current' world profile.
      Profiles are also essential for Axmud's advanced handling of interfaces
         (triggers, aliases, macros, timers and hooks).
      All interfaces can have an associated profile - a trigger can be attached
         to a particular race, a macro attached to a particular character, and
         so on. Profiles have a priority order, so that if there are two
         triggers with the same name, the one associated with the character
         profile trumps the one associated with the race profile. (The priority
         order can be changed, if this isn't what you want.)

      This command changes the profile priority list for the current world.
         <list> should be a list of profile categories - including the standard
         ones ('world', 'guild', 'race' and 'char') and any custom categories
         created by profile templates.
      The highest priority category is the first in the list. The last category
         in the list is always 'world', and the list must always contain 'char'.
         The remaining standard categories are optional (but recommended).
      The default priority list is 'char', 'race', 'guild', 'world'.
      (See the help for ';listprofile' for more information about profiles.)
