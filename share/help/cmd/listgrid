lgr / listgrid                Lists workspace grids
 
   Format:
      ;lgr                    Lists all workspace grids 
 
      ;lgr -s                 Lists workspace grids for this session
      ;lgr -s <number>        Lists workspace grids for session <number>

      ;lgr -w                 Lists workspace grids for the default workspace
      ;lgr -w <number>        Lists workspace grids for workspace <number>

   Notes:
      The workspace grid is an invisible grid, spanning the whole available
         workspace, on which Axmud tries to arrange its windows so that they 
         don't overlap (as far as possible). The grid is divided into zones 
         within which one or more windows are arranged. The 'blueprint' for 
         zones on a desktop is called a 'zonemap'. 
      Only 'grid' windows (including the 'main' window, task windows and the 
         automapper window) are arranged on the workspace grid. Temporary
         windows, including the GUI window and all edit, preference, wizard and
         dialogue windows, are not affected.

      This command lists workspace grids currently in use. Use ';listsession' to 
         get a list of session numbers, and use ';listworkspace' to get a list 
         of workspace numbers.

      The ';toggleshare' command sets whether sessions should share a single
         'main' window, or not. When they don't share a single 'main' window,
         they instead share a single workspace grid. In that case, if you use 
         the -s switch, all workspace grids are listed.
