qal / quitall                 Sends 'quit' to every world and saves files

   Format:
      ;qal                    Sends the 'quit' command to every world
      ;qal <minutes>          Sends 'quit' commands after a delay

   Notes:
      Used to terminate the connection naturally in every world (it may take a
         few moments for the worlds to respond).
      This command initiates the auto-quit sequence. The sequence depends on the
         current world profile's auto-quit mode. The default mode, mode 0, just
         sends a 'quit' command to the world. Other modes can send a sequence of
         world commands, or start a task, Axbasic script or mission to terminate
         the connection.
      Use the ';quit' or ';qquit' commands to close an individual connection.
      See also the help for ';abortselfdestruct'.
