spd / setpromptdelay          Sets a system prompt delay time

   Format:
      ;spd -p <interval>      Sets the system prompt delay (in seconds)
      ;spd -p                 Resets the system prompt delay

      ;spd -l <interval>      Sets the login warning delay (in seconds)
      ;spd -l                 Resets the login warning delay

   Notes:
      Sometimes the client receives text that doesn't end in a newline character
         (an invisible character that instructs the client to start a new line).
         This may be because only half a line has been received (and that the
         rest is on its way), or it may be that the world has sent a prompt like
         'Enter your name'.
      The system prompt delay specifies how long Axmud should wait, before
         treating such a line as a prompt. The default value is 0.5 seconds.
         <interval> must be in the range 0.1 - 5.

      After connecting to a world, the login warning delay specifies how long
         Axmud should wait, before warning the user that they have not yet
         logged in. (Many Axmud processes, including many tasks, can only start
         once the login process is complete.)
      The default value is 30 seconds. If <interval> is 0, no warning is shown.

   User commands:
      spd / setdelay / setpromptdelay
