pse / playsoundeffect         Plays a sound effect and shows a system message
 
   Format:
      ;pse <name>             Plays the sound effect <name>
 
   Notes:
      Axmud's sound effects bank contains a list of named sound effects, each of 
         which corresponds to a sound file. This command can be used to play 
         sound effects in the bank.
      If sound is turned off or if the sound effect <name> doesn't exist, you'll
         see a system error message. If the sound effect is played, you'll see a
         normal system message.
      You might prefer to avoid cluttering up the window with system messages,
         for example when you're creating a trigger whose response to a stimulus
         is to play a sound effect. In that case, you can use the ';beep' and
         ';quicksoundeffect' commands.
