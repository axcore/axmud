css / chatsetsmiley           Turns smileys in all chat sessions on/off

   Format:
      ;css on                 Turns on smileys
      ;cse off                Turns off smileys

   Notes:
      The Chat task is used to chat with other players directly via telnet.
         Calls can be placed (or accepted) with any user whose MUD client uses
         the zChat or MudMaster protocols.
      Chat sessions are able to convert strings like :) and :( into a smiley
         icon, but if you and your chat contact are exchanging important
         information, it might be better to turn them off.
