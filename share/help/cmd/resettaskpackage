rtp / resettaskpackage        Resets task package names to defaults
 
   Format:
      ;rtp <task_name>
               Resets task package name for <task_name> to the default
      ;rtp
               Resets all task package names to defaults

   Notes:
      A task package name is the name of the Perl package that handles a task, 
         e.g. 'Games::Axmud::Task::Status' for the Status task.
      <task_name> matches the task's formal name, e.g. 'status_task',
         'locator_task', etc.
      If <task_name> is specified, the corresponding package name will be reset
         to the default. The operation will fail if an instance of the task is
         currently running.
      If <task_name> is not specified, the package names of all tasks (except 
         Axmud's built-in tasks) will be removed, rendering them uncallable. The
         operation will fail if any tasks are currently running.
