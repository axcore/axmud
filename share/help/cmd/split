   Format:

      ;spl sentence           TTS splits text by sentence
      ;spl word               TTS splits text by word
      ;spl                    Switch between lines, sentences and words
      
   Notes:
      When Axmud is performing text-to-speech, you can use the ';skip',
         ';unskip', ';first' and ';last' comamnds to replay text that has been
         read aloud.         
      By default, a whole line of text is replayed. (If it's a very long line,
         it may appear as several lines in Axmud's window).
      You can use this command to replay a single sentence at a time, or a
         single word at a time, if that's what you prefer.
      When you're replaying a single sentence or word at a time, the ';first'
         and ';last' commands will replay the first sentence or word in that
         line. When you're replaying whole lines at a time, the ';first' and
         ';last' commands replay the oldest and most recent lines received,
         respectively.

      When running the version of Axmud that's optimised for visually-impaired 
         users, the home key can be used as a shortcut to this command (but only
         once Axmud is connected to a world, in online or offline  mode.)         
      See also the help for ';resume', ';shutup' and ';freekeys'.
