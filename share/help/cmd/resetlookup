rlu / resetlookup             Resets the list of IP lookup servers
 
   Format:
      ;rlu                    Resets the list
      
   Notes:
      Some parts of the code need to know your IP address (for example, the Chat
         task, and the MNES protocol). Axmud does this by contacting some IP
         lookup servers.
      This command resets the customised list of lookup servers to the default
         list.
      See also the help for ';listlookup' and ';forcelookup'.
