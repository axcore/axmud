drl / deleterelative          Deletes a relative direction
 
   Format:
      ;drl <dir>              Deletes the relative direction <dir>
      ;drl <type>             Deletes the direction in the slot <type>
      ;drl <primary>          Deletes the direction in the slot <primary>

   Notes:
      Relative directions are used by a handful of worlds in which a room's
         exits change depending on the direction in which the character is
         facing (which usually means the direction from which the character
         arrived). See the help for ';addrelative' for a full explanation,
         including what is meant here by a slot.
      This command deletes the relative direction <dir>, and its corresponding
         abbreviate direction (if any).
      You can also specify <type>, which is the relative direction's slot
         expressed as a number in the range 0-7, or <primary>, which is the
         equivalent primary direction (standard or custom) assuming that the
         character arrived from the south.
