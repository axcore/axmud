lso / listsourcecode          Displays mudlib file paths for world model objects
 
   Format:
      ;lso <regions> 
      ;lso <regions> <switches>
               Displays mudlib file paths for the specified <regions>

      ;lso 
      ;lso <switches>
               Displays paths for the automapper window's current region
 
   Notes:
      If you have administrative access to the world's filesystem (also called
         its 'mudlib'), you can store file paths for each of the world's rooms
         in your world model. (Every world model object can store a file path, 
         but usually only rooms have their file paths stored.)
      This command lists the file paths stored for objects in one or more 
         regions.       
      <regions> is a list of region names. If you don't specify any regions, the
         region currently displayed in the automapper window (if any) will be
         used.
      <switches>, if specified, can be one or both of the following:
         -n   Lists objects sorted numerically, rather than by file path
         -a   Lists all objects in the region, not just rooms
 
   User commands:
      lso / listsource / listsourcecode
