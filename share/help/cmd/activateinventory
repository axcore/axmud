aiv / activateinventory       Activates the Inventory/Condition tasks

   Format:
      ;aiv                    Activate the tasks

   Notes:
      When the Inventory task is in 'active' mode, it sends commands such as
         'inventory' to the world at regular intervals, waits for the response
         and then displays a list of objects from the character's inventory in
         the task window.
      When the Condition task is in 'active' mode, it sends commands such as
         'examine axe' to the world at regular intervals, waits for the response
         and then updates the Inventory task's list of objects (the Condition
         task won't run without the Inventory task).
      If the Inventory and Condition tasks are both running, this command
         activates them both. If only the Inventory task is running, it
         activates just that task.
      Both the Inventory and Condition tasks are in 'active' mode when they
         start (by default). Use the ';disactivateinventory' command to
         disactivate them.
