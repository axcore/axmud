aal / addalias                Adds an independent alias
 
   Format:
      ;aal <switches>         Adds an alias
 
   Notes:
      Aliases are one of five types of Axmud interface (the others being 
         triggers, macros, timers and hooks).
      Aliases allow you to define shortcuts for world commands and to have those
         commands modified before being sent to the world.
      This command creates an alias interface that's 'inactive' - it's 
         associated with a particular profile (actually, stored in a 'cage' 
         object associated with that profile). When that profile becomes a 
         current profile - and only if there isn't another alias with the same 
         name, attached to a higher-priority profile - then an 'active' alias is 
         created with the same attributes.
      The alias created is also 'independent', meaning that it doesn't call some 
         part of the Axmud code directly.

      All interfaces have four standard attributes:
         'name'      - A name for the alias
         'stimulus'  - What causes the alias to 'fire'. The stimulus is a 
                          pattern in the form of a Perl regular expression (or
                          'regex'). An example of a simple pattern would be
                          '^hello$', which causes the alias to fire whenever the
                          user types the (exact) command 'hello' - but regexes
                          of any complexity can be used.
         'response'  - The substitution to perform. An example of a response 
                          would be 'greet all', being the world command sent
                          when the user types 'hello'. 
                     - The substitution performed is in fact a standard Perl 
                          s/// substitution, so valid alias responses include:
                          
                             'open $1; go $2; open $3' 
                             
                     - However, if the substitution begins with a forward slash,
                          it is treated as a Perl command which is evaluated
                          like any other Perl command. The return value (if any)
                          is sent as a world command, regardless of its first
                          character
         'enabled'   - A flag set to 1 (default) or 0. When set to 1, the active
                          alias is enabled (does something). When set to 0, it 
                          is disabled (temporarily does nothing)
      Aliases also have the following non-standard attributes:
         'ignore_case'
                     - A flag set to 1 (default) or 0. - If set to 1, the 
                          substitution ignores case (so the typed command 
                          'HELLO' would match the stimulus pattern 'Hello'). If 
                          set to 0, substitutions are case-sensitive
         'keep_checking' 
                     - A flag set to 1 or 0 (default). If set to 0, after the 
                          first alias fires, the world command is sent 
                          immediately and no more aliases are checked. If set to
                          1, Axmud continues to check the command against other
                          aliases, meaning that it might be substituted several
                          times before it is sent to the world 
         'temporary' - A flag set to 1 or 0 (default). When set to 1, the active
                          interface is destroyed after the alias fires for the
                          first time. When set to 0, the interface can fire
                          indefinitely

      <switches> allows you to define which attributes the alias will have and
         with which profile it will be associated.
 
      Group 1 switch options: one of the following options must be used:
         -no option-          - Adds an alias belonging to the current world
         -w                   - Adds an alias belonging to the current world
         -g                   - Adds an alias belonging to the current guild
         -r                   - Adds an alias belonging to the current race
         -c                   - Adds an alias belonging to the current char
         -x <category>        - Adds an alias belonging to the current custom
                                   profile <category>
         -d <prof>            - Adds an alias belonging to profile <prof>

      Group 2 switch options: both of the following options must be used:
         -s <pattern>         - Sets the 'stimulus' attribute (a regex)
         -p <substitution>    - Sets the 'response' attribute (a Perl 
                                   substitution)
      Group 3 switch options: 0, 1 or more of the following options can be
         used:
         -n <string>          - Sets the 'name' attribute (a string). If not
                                   specified, a name is generated for you
         -e <boolean>         - Sets the 'enabled' attribute (1 or 0; default is
                                   1)
         -o <boolean>         - Sets the 'ignore_case' attribute (1 or 0, 
                                   default is 1)
         -k <boolean>         - Sets the 'keep_checking' attribute (1 or 0; 
                                   default is 0)
         -t <boolean>         - Sets the 'temporary' attribute (1 or 0; default
                                   is 0)
      Group 4 switch options: 0, 1 or more of the following options can be
         used:
         -b <name>            - This alias is checked before aliases called
                                   <name> (when they both become active)
         -f <name>            - This alias is checked after aliases called
                                   <name> (when they both become active)

   General interface notes:
      If <instruction>, <pattern>, <string> or <substitution> contain 
         whitespace, they must be enclosed by diamond brackets
         
            e.g. <You see (.*) exits>
            
      <boolean> can be typed as 1 or 0, or any word beginning with t, T, f or F
