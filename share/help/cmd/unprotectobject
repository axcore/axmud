upr / unprotectobject         Removes an object's semi-protection
 
   Format:
      ;upr <number>           Removes protected object <number>
 
   Notes:
      'Protected' objects enjoy semi-protection against being sold, dropped or
         used collectively in other ways while the Inventory task is running
         (see the help for the ';protectobject' command).
      This command removes an object from the current character's list of
         protected objects. Use the ';listprotectobject' command to get a 
         numbered list of protected objects.
 
   User commands:
      upr / unprotect / unprotectobj / unprotectobject
