itr / importtrigger           Imports trigger(s) from the interface clipboard

   Format:
      ;itr <name> <switches>  Imports the trigger called <name>
      ;itr <switches>         Imports all clipboard triggers

   Notes:
      Triggers are one of five types of Axmud interface (the others being
         aliases, macros, timers and hooks).
      Triggers allow you to react automatically to text received from the world.
         The reaction can have one of three forms: the trigger can execute an
         instruction (including world commands, forced world commands, client
         commands, echo commands, Perl commands, script commands and multi
         commands) or it can split a line into two (a 'splitter' trigger), or it
         can change the way the received text is displayed in the 'main' window
         (a 'rewriter' trigger).
      This command provides a simple way to copy triggers from one profile/cage
         to another (perhaps even in a different world, in a different session).
         Having 'exported' the trigger to Axmud's interface clipboard using the
         ';importtrigger' command, that trigger can then be 'imported'.
      Note that the contents of the clipboard are not saved. Note also that the
         trigger's attributes might change while stored in the clipboard. In
         other words, it's up to you to perform the export, then the import,
         before doing anything else.
      If an active trigger was exported, an inactive trigger is imported. The
         imported trigger will not replace an existing trigger with the same
         name.

      <switches> allows you to specify which profile's trigger cage should
         receive the imported triggers. One of the following (group 1) switches
         may be specified:
         (no switch)   - Imports trigger(s) to the current world
         -w            - Imports trigger(s) to the current world
         -r            - Imports trigger(s) to the current race
         -g            - Imports trigger(s) to the current guild
         -c            - Imports trigger(s) to the current char
         -x <category> - Imports trigger(s) to the current custom profile
                            <category>
         -d <prof>     - Imports trigger(s) to the profile named <prof>

   User commands:
      itr / imptrig / imptrigger / importtrig / importtrigger
