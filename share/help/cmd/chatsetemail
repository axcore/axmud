cse / chatsetemail            Sets your chat email

   Format:
      ;cse <email>            Sets your chat email to <email>
      ;cse                    Stops broadcasting your email in chat sessions

   Notes:
      The Chat task is used to chat with other players directly via telnet.
         Calls can be placed (or accepted) with any user whose MUD client uses
         the zChat or MudMaster protocols.
      Chat sessions using the zChat protocol are able to broadcast an email
         address to your chat contacts (a service which is turned off, by
         default).
      This command sets the address to broadcast. If you don't specify an
         address, none is broadcast. All existing chat sessions are updated and
         the address is stored so that it will be available in future sessions.
      <email>, if specified, must be between 3 and 128 characters (and contain
         the @ character).

   User commands:
