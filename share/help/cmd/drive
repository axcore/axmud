drv / drive                   Moves the character using pre-defined routes

   Format:
      ;drv <start> <stop>     Moves from the room <start> to the room <stop>
      ;drv <stop>             Moves from the current room to the room <stop>

   Notes:
      Axmud pre-defined routes are an easy way to move between rooms in the
         world (see the help for ';addroute' for information about routes).
      This command moves the character between two rooms - whose room tags are
         <start> and <stop> - using only pre-defined routes.
      If the Locator task already knows the current room's tag (i.e. if you can
         see the tag in the task window), you can omit <start>.
      If there is no pre-defined route between <start> and <stop>, Axmud will
         try to work out the shortest path between the rooms by combining other
         pre-defined routes.

      This command uses both 'road' and 'quick' routes. You can use the ';road'
         command to move using only road routes, or you can use the ';quick'
         command to move using only quick routes. The ';circuit' command can be
         used to move along a circuit route.
      You can also use the ';go' command to move around the world using the
         automapper and the world model.
