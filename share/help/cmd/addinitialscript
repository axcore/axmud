ais / addinitialscript        Adds a script to an initial scriptlist

   Format:
      ;ais <script>
      ;ais <script> <switch>
               Adds the <script> to the global initial scriptlist

      ;ais <script> <profile>
      ;ais <script> <profile> <switch>
               Adds the <script> to the <profile>'s initial scriptlist

   Notes:
      Initial scripts are started when Axmud marks the current character as
         logged in (you can use the ';login' command to override the automatic
         process, if necessary), or when the user changes a current profile with
         commands like ';setworld' and ';setchar'.
      There are two types of initial scriptlist - one 'global' list which
         contains a list of scripts which apply to every world, and a separate
         set of initial scriptlists stored in each profile.
      When a current profile changes, any Script tasks that were created from
         the old profile's initial scriptlist are halted before the new current
         profile's initial scripts are started.

      Axbasic scripts are stored as files in Axmud's data directory (in the
         'scripts' sub-directory). <script> matches the file name (without its
         .bas extension).
      <switch> specifies whether the script is run from within a task, or not.
         If <switch> is not specified, no task is used; otherwise, <switch> can
         should be one of the following:
            -r   Run the script without a task
            -t   Run the script from within a Script task
            -c   Run the script from within a Script task, in 'forced window'
                    mode

   User commands:
      ais / addinitscript / addinitialscript
