submit / chatsubmit           Allows chat contacts to send remote commands
 
   Format:
      ;submit -n <name>       Allows commands from chat contacts called <name>
      ;submit -g <group>      Allows commands from everyone in the <group>
      ;submit                 Allows commands from everyone
 
   Notes:
      The Chat task is used to chat with other players directly via telnet.
         Calls can be placed (or accepted) with any user whose MUD client uses
         the zChat or MudMaster protocols.
      This command is the equivalent of typing ';submit' in the relevant Chat
         task windows. Note that remote commands can only be sent in chat
         sessions using the zChat protocol. You'll get an error message if you 
         try to send them in a MudMaster session.
      The switches -n and -g can't be combined.
 
   User commands:
      submit / chatsubmit
