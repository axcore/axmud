flw / flashwindow             Sets a 'grid' window's urgency hint
 
   Format:
      ;flw <number>           Makes window <number> flash
      ;flw                    Makes the session's 'main' window flash
 
   Notes:
      The effect of setting a window's urgency hint varies depending on the
         desktop environment you're using. Often, it causes the window to flash
         in the panel at the bottom (or top) of the screen.
      For a list of 'grid' window <number>s, use the ';listwindow' command.
