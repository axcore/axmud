shh / showhistory             Displays the current world's connection history
 
   Format:
      ;shh                    Shows connection history
      ;shh <char>             Shows connection history for the <char>
 
   Notes:
      Axmud is able to store basic details about past connection to a world. 
      This command shows the connection history for the current world. If you
         specify a <char>, only connections using that character as the current
         character profile are shown. 
      Storage can be turned on or off with the ';togglehistory' command, and the
         current world's entire connection can be erased with the 
         ';clearhistory' command.
