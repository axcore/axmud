sam / setassistedmoves        Turns assisted moves on/off

   Format:
      ;sam on                 Turns assisted moves on
      ;sam off                Turns assisted moves off
      ;sam                    Shows whether assisted moves are on or off

   Notes:
      If the automapper knows the character's current location, you can use
         assisted moves to move through one of the room exit's using a single
         command (e.g. 'east') rather than a sequence of commands (e.g. 'knock
         on door', 'ring bell', 'open door', 'enter').
      Assisted moves can be turned on and off from the automapper window's menu
         or by using this command.
      Assisted moves are not available when 'redirect mode' is turned on (see
         the help for ';redirectmode').

   User commands:
      sam / setam / setassistedmove / setassistedmoves
