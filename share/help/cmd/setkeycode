skc / setkeycode              Sets an individual keycode
 
   Format:
      ;skc <standard> <system>     
               Sets the <standard> keycode <system>
      ;skc <standard> <keycode_string>     
               Sets the <standard> keycode to a keycode string
 
   Notes:
      Keycodes are used by the system to recognise the keys on your keyboard.
         For example, the F5 key usually has the keycode 'F5', and the two SHIFT 
         keys often have the keycodes 'Shift_L' and 'Shift_R'.
      Keycodes vary between systems, so Axmud offers a set of standard keycodes
         (for example 'f5' and 'shift'). Axmud represents two keys pressed down
         together as a keycode string like 'shift f5' or 'ctrl c'. 
      Axmud's standard keycodes are mostly used with macros; they allow you to 
         design macros that will work on all systems, not just the one you're 
         using right now.
      Keycodes (and keycode strings) are stored in a keycode object. You might
         have one called 'linux' and another one called 'windows', one of which
         would be set as the 'current' keycode object. 

      This command sets the system keycode that's used with an Axmud standard
         keycode in the current keycode object.
      <standard> is the Axmud standard keycode, for example 'f5' or 'backspace'. 
         <system> is the system keycode, for example 'F5' or 'BackSpace'.
      Some standard keycodes (for example those representing the SHIFT and CTRL
         keys) can be used with more than one system keycode. In that case, the
         system keycodes should be enclosed with diamond brackets <...>, e.g.
         
            ;setkeycode shift <Shift_L Shift_R>
            
      You can view your system's keycodes using the ';getkeycode' command.

      Some Axmud standard keycodes have alternative names that you can use 
         freely in your macros (and with this command); for example, 'page_up' 
         can also be called 'pageup'.
      A few American English forms are also recognised; for example, 'full_stop'
         and 'period' are equivalent.
      Use ';listkeycodealternative' to get a list of alternative forms for 
         Axmud's standard keycodes.
