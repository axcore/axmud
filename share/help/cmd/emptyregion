ern / emptyregion             Empties a world model region
 
   Format:
      ;ern <number>           Empties the region <number>
      ;ern <name>             Empties the region <name>
 
   Notes:
      The world model stores information about the regions, rooms, characters
         and objects in the game world. The automapper window uses the 
         information stored in the world model to draw its maps.
      This command empties all the rooms (and other child objects) in the 
         specified region. Any labels on the regionmap are also removed. 
         However, any child regions are not deleted.

   User commands:
      ern / emptyregion
