rw / restoreworld             Restores pre-configured worlds
 
   Format:
      ;rw                     Restores all pre-configured worlds
      ;rw <name>              Restores the pre-configured world <name>
 
   Notes:
      Axmud comes with a number of pre-configured worlds. When Axmud starts for
         the first time, those worlds are automatically loaded. However, over 
         time the world profiles will be modified, and perhaps even deleted;
         this command can be used to restore the pre-configured worlds to their
         default state. 
      Because of the risk of corrupting your existing data files, this command
         is only available when you are not connected to any world. In addition,
         when the operation is complete, Axmud will shut down without saving 
         files (except for files belonging to the newly-restored world).  
      For this reason, best results can be achieved by starting Axmud, opening a 
         single connection to any world in 'offline' mode, running the command, 
         and then re-starting Axmud to check the results. 

      You should definitely CREATE A BACK UP OF THE ENTIRE AXMUD DATA DIRECTORY
         before you start, in case anything goes wrong.
      In most cases it's better to use the ';updateworld' command, which is able  
         to read data stored in the pre-configured world files and then merge
         that data with the current world profile's existing properties. In
         addition, ';updateworld' can be used while conneceted to a world.
