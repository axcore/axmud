lep / listexitpattern         Lists the world profile's exit patterns
 
   Format:
      ;lep <switches>         Lists exit patterns
 
   Notes:
      The Locator task uses exit patterns, defined by the current world profile,
         to spot when a character's attempts to move fail (or when the character
         is moved involuntarily). Every exit pattern is a Perl regular 
         expression.
      Because they also appear just after a character move, this command can 
         also be used to list dark room patterns and unspecified room patterns.
         (Unspecified room patterns match lines sent by the world when the 
         character has arrived in a new room for which the world hasn't sent a 
         new room statement, as it normally would.)

      <switches> can be one or more of the following:
         -d   Lists door patterns, e.g. '^You bump into a door!'
         -l   Lists locked door patterns, e.g. '^It's locked!'
         -f   Lists failed exit patterns, e.g. '^You can't go that way!'
         -r   Lists dark room patterns, e.g. '^You can't see a thing!'
         -u   Lists unspecified room patterns, e.g. '^You land with a thump'
         -i   Lists involuntary exit patterns, e.g. '^You run for your life!'
         -a   Lists of all these patterns
 
   User commands:
      lep / listexitpattern
