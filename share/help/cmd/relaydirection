rel / relaydirection          Sends a non-movement command to the world
 
   Format:
      ;rel <direction>        Move the character in <direction>
 
   Notes:
      Some world commands should cause the world to send a room statement in 
         response. (A room statement is the complete room description, including 
         any exits and the room's contents.)
      This generally includes the commands for 'look', 'glance', 'go', 'sail', 
         'fly' (and so on). Axmud stores world commands that have been sent, and
         marks any that it thinks will cause a room statement to be received.
      When the Locator task is running, it works out how many room statements to 
         expect by counting how many of these commands have been sent.

      In some situations it might be desirable to inform Axmud that the 
         direction to be sent is definitely not a movement command - for 
         example, when answering an NPC's question by typing a command like 
         'north' directly. You can use ';relaydirection' in this situation.
      ';movedirection' can be used to send a movement command. 
 
   User commands:
      rel / relay / relaydir / relaydirection
