bud / backupdata              Creates a backup copy of the Axmud data directory
 
   Format:
      ;bud                    Creates a backup copy
      ;bud -t                 Creates a backup copy in .tgz format
      ;bud -z                 Creates a backup copy in .zip format
 
   Notes:
      Axmud stores all of its data files in a single directory (folder). This
         command makes a backup copy of the whole directory.
      To restore all of your data files from a backup file, see the help for
         ';restoredata'. You can tell Axmud to automatically make backup files
         at regular intervals using the ';autobackup' command.

      The backup file is a single compressed file. On Linux, a .tgz file is
         created. On MS Windows, a .zip file is created. You can specify the
         -t or -z switch to override this behaviour, if you want. (Axmud can
         read both types of file on all systems.)
      If you've specified a directory in which backup files should be saved
         (using the ';autobackup' command), the backup file is saved there.
         Otherwise you'll be prompted to choose a directory.

      See also the help for ';setdatadirectory'.
