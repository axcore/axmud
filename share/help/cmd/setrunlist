srl / setrunlist              Sets one of the task runlists

   Format:
      ;srl                    Shows task runlists
      ;srl -d                 Restores runlists to their defaults
      ;srl -f <list>          Sets the <list> of tasks to be run first
      ;srl -l <list>          Sets the <list> of tasks to be run last

   Notes:
      Some kinds of task may run more efficiently if they know that, on each
         task loop, they will be run before other types of task. Some kinds of
         task work best when they are run last.
      Task runlists are a shorts list of tasks that are run before or after all
         the others.
      ';setrunlist -f <list>' defines a list of tasks to be run first. The first
         task in the list is run first.
      ';setrunlist -l <list>' defines a list of tasks to be run last. The list
         is run in reverse order, so the first task in the list is run LAST.
      Each entry on a runlist is a type of task. You can specify a task label
         (e.g. 'status') or its formal name (e.g. 'status_task'). Task labels
         are automatically converted into a task's formal name.
      If there are multiple copies of one type of task, and if that task type
         appears on the runlist, all the copies will be run together (one at a
         time), before (or after) other types on the list.
      Types of task which don't appear on either list are run (in a non-
         predictable order) after the 'first' runlist, but before the 'last'
         runlist.
      On each task loop, every task can be run only once, so putting a task type
         on both lists won't cause it to be run twice per task loop.
      ';setrunlist -d' restores the default runlists. If you create your own
         customised runlists, they are saved in Axmud's 'config' file: the list
         doesn't change when you switch to another world.
      If you use the switches -f or -l without a <list>, the runlists are
         emptied.
