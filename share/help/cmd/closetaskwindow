ctw / closetaskwindow         Closes a task's own window

   Format:
      ;ctw <task>             Closes the task window for <task>
      ;ctw -a                 Closes windows for all current tasks

   Notes:
      ';ctw -a' closes the task window for all tasks that have one open. Closing
         the window will often cause the task to shut down completely.
      <task> can be any Axmud built-in or external task that's currently
         running.
      <task> can be in the form of a task's label (e.g. 'stat, 'status'), its
         formal name (e.g. 'status_task') or the task's unique name (e.g.
         'status_task_4').
      (Use the ';listtasklabel' command to list all task labels.)
