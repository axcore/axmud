ecg / editcage                Opens an 'edit' window for a cage

   Format:
      ;ecg <name>             Edits the cage <name>

      ;ecg -t                 Edits the current world's trigger cage
      ;ecg -a                 Edits the current world's alias cage
      ;ecg -m                 Edits the current world's macro cage
      ;ecg -i                 Edits the current world's timer cage
      ;ecg -h                 Edits the current world's hook cage
      ;ecg -c                 Edits the current world's command cage
      ;ecg -r                 Edits the current world's route cage

   Notes:
      <name> is the cage's full name, e.g. 'trigger_guild_thief'.
      If you specify one of the switches instead of <name>, a cage belonging to
         the current world will open at its second page; this is a convenient
         shortcut to display a list of triggers, aliases and so on with just one
         command.

   User commands:
