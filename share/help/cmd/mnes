mnes / mnes                   Manages the MUD NEW-ENVIRON Standard (MNES)

   Format:
      ;mnes                   Shows MNES settings
      ;mnes -s                Enables/disables sending user's IP address

   Notes:
      The MUD NEW-ENVIRON Standard is an extension of the NEW-ENVIRON protocol
         which sends more information about the client to the world.
      Most of this information is also sent by other protocols, but there is one
         important exception: MNES can send the user's real IP address.
      The intention is to allow MUD administrators to ban a misbehaving user's
         real IP address, rather than a whole range of proxies they may be
         using. Nevertheless, Axmud hides your real IP address by default.
      You can use this command to allow MNES to send your real IP address, if
         that's what you want.

   User commands:
      mnes
