dem / dumpexitmodel           Lists all exit model objects

   Format:
      ;dem                    Shows all exit objects

   Notes:
      The world model stores information about the regions, rooms, characters
         and objects in the game world. The automapper window uses the model to
         display its maps.
      This command dumps the list of exit model objects to the 'main' window. It
         should be used cautiously (because a large exit model will take a very
         long time to be displayed).

   User commands:
