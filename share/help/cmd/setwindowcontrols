swc / setwindowcontrols       Sets custom window controls sizes

   Format:
      ;swc <switches>         Sets custom window controls sizes

   Notes:
      Window controls are the borders around the edges of all windows on the
         desktop. Axmud needs to know their sizes to get its window positioning
         right.
      This command specifies custom sizes for window controls. Usually, Axmud
         detects window controls sizes for every workspace it uses, so you'll
         probably only need to use this command if detection fails. (Window
         controls sizes specified with this command override detected sizes.)
      After specifying window controls sizes, you can use the ';resetgrid' or
         ';testwindowcontrols' commands to adjust the position of windows on the
         desktop.

      <switches> consists of one or more of the following options, in any order:
         -l <size>   - Sets the left controls size
         -l          - Resets the left controls size
         -r <size>   - Sets the right controls size
         -r          - Resets the right controls size
         -t <size>   - Sets the top controls size
         -t          - Resets the top controls size
         -b <size>   - Sets the bottom controls size
         -b          - Resets the bottom controls size

      See also the help for ';testwindowcontrols' and ';listwindowcontrols'.
