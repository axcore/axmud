lpl / loadplugin              Loads an Axmud plugin

   Format:
      ;lpl <path>             Loads a plugin from the file <path>
      ;lpl                    Loads a plugin stored in Axmud's data directory
      ;lpl -s                 Loads a standard plugin
      ;lpl -a                 Loads all standard plugins

   Notes:
      Axmud plugins are Perl modules which allow you to extend Axmud's core
         functionality with new tasks, client commands, cages, 'edit' windows
         and menu items, all of them integrating seemlessly with the existing
         Axmud code.
      Because of an unresolved Perl issue, plugins can only be loaded from
         Axmud's data directory. If you've downloaded a plugin (for example,
         from the Axmud website), you should use ';importplugin' first, which
         copies the file to the correct location in Axmud's data directory.

      This command loads an Axmud plugin immediately. If you want to load
         plugins every time Axmud starts, use the ';addinitialplugin' command.
      If you specify <path>, it should be the full file path to the plugin.
         Otherwise, you will be prompted to choose a plugin to load.
      Axmud provides a number of standard plugins, and if you specify the '-s'
         switch you'll see the directory (folder) where standard plugins are
         stored. Otherwise you'll see the directory where plugins you write
         youself can be stored.
      (The '-a' switch, which loads all standard plugins, is a debugging command
         which you will probably never need to use.)

      Axmud plugins must be .pm files which start with a header in a certain
         format. If the header is not in this format, the plugin is not loaded:

            #!/usr/bin/perl
            package <name>;
            #: Version: <version>
            #: Description: <description>
            #: Author: <author>
            #: Copyright: <copyright message>
            #: Require: <Axmud version>
            #: Init: <string>

      The first line must contain a Perl shebang (#!/usr/bin/perl).
      After the first line, the header may contain any number of empty lines or
         lines containing whitespace followed by an ordinary Perl comment (both
         of which are ignored).
      The second line (not counting any ignored lines) must contain the package
         name. <name> is both the name of the Perl package and the name of the
         plugin. If a plugin with that name has already been loaded, the new
         plugin is not loaded.

      The remaining lines may occur in any order. The 'Version' and
         'Description' lines are compulsory; the others are optional. Duplicate
         lines replace an earlier line, for example the following partial header
         sets the author to JRR Tolkien:

            #: Author: JK Rowling
            #: Author: JRR Tolkien

      The Perl shebang and package name may occur only once, however.

      If specified, <Axmud version> sets the minimum Axmud version. If an
         earlier version of Axmud is running, the plugin will not load.
         <Axmud version> can be in the form 'v1.0.0', 'V1.0.0' or '1.0.0'.
      If specified, the 'Init' line sets whether the plugin starts enabled or
         disabled. <string> can be any of the following strings: 'enable',
         'enabled', 'disable' or 'disabled'. If any other string is used, or if
         the line is not specified at all, the plugin starts enabled.
      The whole header is case-sensitive (except for <string>, which is
         case-insensitive). The following line will not be recognised as part of
         the header:

            #: author: JRR Tolkien

         ';addinitialplugin'.
