   Format:
      ;lrt <start> <switches>
                              Lists routes

   Notes:
      Axmud pre-defined routes are an easy way to move between rooms in the
         world (see the help for ';addroute' for information about routes).

      Both <start> and <switches> are optional.
      If <start> is specified, only routes starting from the room with the tag
         <start> are listed.
      If <switches> are specified, only those routes associated with a
         particular profile will be listed. <switches> can be any one of the
         following switch options:
         -no pattern-         - Lists routes associated with all current
                                   profiles
         -w                   - Lists routes associated with the current world
         -g                   - Lists routes associated with the current guild
         -r                   - Lists routes associated with the current race
         -c                   - Lists routes associated with the current
                                   character
         -x <category>        - Lists routes associated with the current custom
                                   profile <category>
         -d <prof>            - Lists routes associated with profile <prof>
