   Format:
      ;mma <switches>         Modifies a macro
 
   Notes:
      Macros are one of five types of Axmud interface (the others being 
         triggers, aliases, timers and hooks).
      Macros allow you to specify instructions to be executed automatically when
         a certain key (or combination of keys) is pressed.
      This command modifies the attributes of an existing 'inactive' macro (one
         associated with a particular profile) and its corresponding 'active'
         macro, if there is one.
      It's also possibly to modify the active macro directly, in which case, the
         the changes won't apply to the parent inactive macro (and will only 
         last for the session, or until the active macro is deleted).
      
      <switches> allows you to define which macro (and which of its attributes)
         should be modified.

      To modify the active macro directly, one of the following (group 0) switch 
         options must be used:
         -i <name>            - Modifies the active macro <name>
         -i <number>          - Modifies the active macro <number>
      However, to modify the inactive macro (and the active macro based on it, 
         if there is one), one of the following (group 1) switch options must 
         be used instead:
         <name>               - Modifies macro belonging to the current world
         <name> -w            - Modifies macro belonging to the current world
         <name> -r            - Modifies macro belonging to the current race
         <name> -g            - Modifies macro belonging to the current guild
         <name> -c            - Modifies macro belonging to the current char
         <name> -x <category> - Modifies macro belonging to the current custom
                                   profile <category>
         <name> -d <prof>     - Modifies macro belonging to the profile named
                                   <prof>

      One or more of the following group 2/3 switch options must be used.
      Group 2 switch options: 
         -s <keycode>         - Modifies the 'stimulus' attribute (a keycode or
                                   keycode string)
         -p <instruction>     - Modifies the 'response' attribute (the   
                                   instruction to execute)
      Group 3 switch options: 
         -e <boolean>         - Modifies the 'enabled' attribute (1 or 0) 
         -t <boolean>         - Modifies the 'temporary' attribute (1 or 0, 
                                   default is 0)
      N.B. The 'name' attribute can't be modified.

      Group 4 switch options (only modify the inactive macro, so can't be used
         with the -i switch):
         -b <name>            - This macro is checked before macros called 
                                   <name> (when they both become active)
         -y <name>            - This macro is not checked before macros called 
                                   <name> (when they both become active)
         -f <name>            - This macro is checked after macros called <name> 
                                   (when they both become active)
         -z <name>            - This macro is not checked after macros called 
                                   <name> (when they both become active)

   General interface notes:
      If <instruction>, <pattern>, <string> or <substitution> contain 
         whitespace, they must be enclosed by diamond brackets
         
            e.g. <You see (.*) exits>
            
      <boolean> can be typed as 1 or 0, or any word beginning with t, T, f or F
