wmp / setwimpy                Sets local/remote wimpy level
 
   Format:
      ;wmp <number>           Sets local wimpy to <number> (0-100)
      ;wmp -r <number>        Sets remote wimpy to <number>
      ;wmp                    Shows current local/remote wimpy setting

   Notes:
      The local and remote wimpy levels are stored in the current character
         profile.
      The local wimpy level is always in the range 0-100, where 0 means 'brave',
         50 means 'run away when the character's health points reach 50%', and
         100 means 'run away at the first sign of trouble'.
      The remote wimpy level is identical to that used by the current world.
      
      The Status task can be set up to monitor changes to the character's wimpy
         levels, but no part of the Axmud code will make the character run away;
         it's up to you to write own tasks or Axbasic scripts to do that.
