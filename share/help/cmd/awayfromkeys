afk / awayfromkeys            Sets an alert for when the world sends text

   Format:
      ;afk                    Sets a visual and sound alert
      ;afk -v                 Sets a visual alert only
      ;afk -s                 Sets a sound alert only

   Notes:
      This command sets an alert which notifies you the next time text is
         received from the world. The alert can consist of a visual hint, or the
         playing of a sound effect, or both.
      You will only be able to hear sound if sound has been turned on (see the
         help for ';sound').
      See also the help for ';setreminder'.
