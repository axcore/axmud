ltm / listtemplate            Lists profile templates for the current world
 
   Format:
      ;ltm                    Lists profile templates
 
   Notes:
      The blueprint for a new category of profile is called a profile template. 
         Several custom profiles can be based on a single template.
      Standard profiles have the category 'world', 'guild', 'race' or 'char'.
         Custom profiles have the category of the template on which they're
         based. This command lists all the templates for the current world from 
         which new custom profiles with the same <category> can be created.
      (See the help for ';listprofile' for more information about profiles.)
