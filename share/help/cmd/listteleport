lpt / listteleport            Lists teleport locations
 
   Format:
      ;lpt                    Lists teleport locations
 
   Notes:
      The ';teleport' command is a convenient way of jumping around any world
         which implements some kind of teleportation system (in which you can 
         jump to a destination room from many different departure rooms). 
      The advantage of using that client command, rather than typing a world
         command like 'portal tower', is that the automapper won't get lost when 
         you use ';teleport'.

      The ';addteleport' command is used to add a teleport destination to 
         Axmud's world model. This command lists all teleport destinations that 
         have been added.
      A full explanation of how this works can be found in the help for the
         ';teleport' command. See also the help for ';addteleport' and
         ';deleteteleport'.

   User commands:
      lpt / listport / listteleport
