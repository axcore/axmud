mwz / modifywinzone           Modifies an existing winzone

   Format:
      ;mwz <name> <number> <switches>
               Modifies a winzone <number> in the winmap <name>

   Notes:
      Winmaps are a plan for arranging the layout of 'internal' windows
         (consisting of all 'main' windows, 'protocol' windows such as those
         created by MXP, and 'custom' windows such as task windows).
      See the help for ';addwinmap' for more information about winmaps, and see
         the help for ';addwinzone' for more information about winzones.

      <switches> consist of the following optional switch options:
        -p <x coord> <y coord>  - Winzone's position (in blocks) on the table
        -s <width> <height>     - Winzone's size (in blocks) on the table
        -n <package>            - The package name of the table object to be
                                     created in this winzone, for example
                                     'Games::Axmud::Table::Pane'. The initial
                                     'Games::Axmud::Table::' part can be
                                     omitted, for example just use 'Pane'; note
                                     that capitalisation must be preserved)
        -o <name>               - A name to give to the table object, when it is
                                     created. Can be any string. If not
                                     specified, the table object's name is the
                                     same as its number, so avoid using numbers.
                                     Max 16 characters
        -i <key>
        -i <key> <value>        - Adds an initialisation property, <key>, set to
                                     <value> (if specified). Initialisation
                                     properties are passed to the table object
                                     when it is created. Any property not
                                     specified here takes itse default value
        -r <key>                - Removes the initialisation property <key>.
                                     Note that all -i switches are processed
                                     before any -r switch is processed. The -i
                                     and -r switches can be used multiple times
                                     in one command
