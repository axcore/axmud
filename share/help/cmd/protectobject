prt / protectobject           Grants an object semi-protection

   Format:
      ;prt <list>
               Protects all items in current inventory matching words in <list>
      ;prt <switch options>
               Creates a protected object matching <switch options>

   Notes:
      'Protected' objects enjoy semi-protection against being sold (with the
         ';sellall' command), dropped (with ';dropall') or used collectively in
         other ways (with ';useall <command>').
      By defining protected objects, you can sell everything in the character's
         inventory (except the protected objects) using a single ';sellall'
         command, rather than by typing 'sell <object>' many times.
      Protected objects are stored in the current character profile, so they
         are also available to any tasks or Axbasic scripts you write yourself.

      Actually, protected objects can be used in two ways. Firstly, you can
         define a protected object based on an actual object in the world
         (usually one that's currently in your character's inventory) by
         creating a protected object with nouns and adjectives that will only
         match one actual world object. So, to protect the real 'the Sword of
         Excalibur', you could create a protected object with the words 'sword'
         and 'excalibur':

            e.g. ';prt sword excalibur'

      Note that the words in <list> are case-insensitive.

      Alternatively, you can give a protected object one or more nouns and
         adjectives that match a wide range of actual world objects. A single
         protected object can then confer protection on many actual world
         objects.
      Protected objects are independent of any real objects from which they were
         created. If you protect your Sword of Excalibur which is then stolen by
         a thief, the protected object still exists - even though the real sword
         is no longer in the character's inventory.
      You can do this by specifying <switch options>, which can be any of the
         following:
         -c category     - The object's category - should be one of 'weapon',
                              'armour', 'garment', 'portable', or 'custom'
                         - Other categories of model object such as 'region' or
                              'decoration' can also be specified, although
                              (logically) they make no sense with this command
         -n <noun>       - The object's main noun, e.g. 'sword'
         -o <other noun> - Any other nouns that can be used for the object - for
                              example, 'sharp' or 'sabre'
         -a <adjective>  - Any adjective that can be used for the object
         -p <pseudo-adj> - Pseudo-adjectives are terms like 'odd-looking' which
                              Axmud normally reduces to a single word
                         - The replacement word (e.g. 'odd') for a pseudo-
                              adjective is stored in the current dictinoary
         -u <unknown>    - Any other descriptive word which isn't stored in the
                              current dictionary as a noun or adjective

      All <switch options> are optional, but they cannot be combined with a
         <list> of words - use one, or the other.
      Any term consisting of multiple words (such as the pseudo-adjective
         'heavily built') should be enclosed by diamond brackets <...>
      Only the first <noun> is used as the protected object's main noun; any
         other nouns you specify will be used as an <other noun>.
      In <switch options> you may specify multiple categories. If you specify a
         a <list> instead, that list can contain categories, and all objects in
         the character's inventory matching that category will be protected:

            e.g. ';prt weapon'    - protects all weapons (but not garments)
