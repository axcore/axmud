drs / deleteregionscheme      Deletes a region colour scheme

   Format:
      ;drs <name>             Deletes the scheme

   Notes:
      A region colour scheme defines a set of colours for one or more regions.
         The automapper window uses these colours when it draws the region(s).
      There is always one region colour scheme, called 'default', which is used
         to draw any regions that hasn't been allocated a custom region colour
         scheme. The default region colour scheme can't be deleted.
      <name> is the name of the scheme to delete. If it contains spaces, you
         should enclose the name in diamond brackets <...>.
