last / last                   Reads aloud the last piece of text

   Format:
      ;last                   Reads aloud the last piece of text

   Notes:
      When Axmud is performing text-to-speech, this command replays the last
         piece of text (if any). If some text is already being read aloud, it is
         interrupted. When reading text one sentence at a time, or one word at
         a time, the last sentence or word in the current line is replayed;
         otherwise, a whole line is replayed.
      When running the version of Axmud that's optimised for visually-impaired
         users, the down cursor key can be used as a shortcut to this command
         (but only once Axmud is connected to a world, in online or offline
         mode.)
      Axmud remembers the last 1000 pieces of text that have been read aloud, so
         you can re-read them at any time.

         ';shutup' and ';freekeys'.
