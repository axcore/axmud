zmp / zmp                     Shows supported ZMP packages/commands

   Format:
      ;zmp                    Shows all ZMP packages
      ;zmp <name>             Shows the package called <name>

   Notes:
      The world can use the ZMP protocol to send extra information about the
         game state.
      A few ZMP commands are 'core' commands, handled (invisibly) by Axmud
         itself. Everything else is handled by a ZMP package.
      ZMP packages are created by plugins. Axmud comes with a plugin,
         'zmptest.pm', which demonstrates how this is done. It needs to be
         loaded before you connect to a world, so you should usually connect to
         any world in 'offline' mode, and then type:

            ;addinitialplugin -s
            ;save

      The plugin creates a ZMP package, and specifies which ZMP commands are
         supported.

      This command lists all the ZMP packages that have been created by any
         loaded plugin, and the commands they support.

   User commands:
      zmp
