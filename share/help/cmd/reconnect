rc / reconnect                Saves files and reconnects to the same world
 
   Format:
      ;rc                     Reconnects to the world
      ;rc  -o                 Reconnects to the world in 'offline' mode
 
   Notes:
      This command reconnects to the same world, first terminating the current
         connection (if there is one) and saving data files. The connection
         opens in a new 'main' window (or in a new tab in a shared 'main'
         window).
      If there is a current character profile, it is re-used. If that 
         character's password is known, automatic logins can take place.
      In offline mode, Axmud simulates a connection to the world; some client
         commands will be available, but others will not.
      Use the ';xconnect' command to reconnect to the mud without saving files.
 
   User commands:
      rc / reconnect
