rws / removeworkspace         Makes a workspace unavailable for Axmud use
 
   Format:
      ;rws <number>           Removes workspace object <number>

   Notes:
      Axmud supports multiple desktops or 'workspaces'. Workspaces can be both
         real and virtual. If you have multiple physical monitors, each one is a
         workspace. If your computer has a workspace switcher, allowing you to 
         switch between virtual desktops, each one is a workspace too.
      This command removes one of your system's workspaces from the list of 
         workspaces Axmud is using. Any windows on that workspace will be 
         closed.
      The default workspace (#0 in Axmud's numbering system) can't be removed. 
         In addition, if session are sharing a single 'main' window, the 
         workspace which contains that window cannot be removed.
          
      For a list of workspace object numbers, use the ';listworkspace' command.
      To modify which workspaces Axmud uses when it starts, see the help for
         ';addinitialworkspace'.
