srm / setroom                 Sets the automapper's current room
 
   Format:
      ;srm <tag>              Sets the current room 
      ;srm <tag> <mode>

      ;srm <number>           Sets the current room 
      ;srm <number> <mode>           
      ;srm -n <number> 
      ;srm -n <number> <mode>
 
   Notes:
      Axmud's automapper is capable of tracking the character's current location
         even when the automapper window isn't open. It's the equivalent of
         using the automapper window in 'follow' mode - no new rooms or exits 
         are added to the world model, but certain statistics, such as the 
         number of visits per room, are still updated.
      To track the character's location, either use this command or set the 
         current location in the automapper window. Opening and closing the 
         window does not affect tracking. (See also the help for ';locateroom'.)

      You can specify <tag>, the room tag of the current room, or <number>, the
         current room's unique number in the world model.
      Room tags can be numerical, so if you want to specify room #100 - not the 
         room whose room tag is 100 - use the optional '-n' switch.
      You can stop the automapper from tracking the character's location with 
         the ';resetroom' command (or by using the automapper window's 
         functions). See also the help for ';go'.

      If the automapper window isn't open, the automapper automatically begins
         tracking the character's location in the world model. If the window is
         open, you can change the operating <mode> at by specifying one of the 
         following switches:

         -w   automapper window switches to 'wait' mode
         -f   switches to 'follow' mode
         -u   switches to 'update' mode

      Note that if 'update' mode is disabled, the automapper window switches to
         'follow' mode instead.
