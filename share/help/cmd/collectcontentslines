ccl / collectcontentslines    Toggles collection of contents lines
 
   Format:
      ;ccl                    Toggles contents collection on/off
 
   Notes:
      The Locator task analyses room statements as they are received, and if it
         finds any unrecognised words in the line(s) containing the room's
         contents, it can store them in the current dictionary (see the help for 
         ';collectunknownwords').
      The Locator task can also store the whole line(s), if that is more 
         convenient.
      This command starts or stops the collection of contents lines. See also 
         the help for ';emptycontentslines' and ';listcontentslines'.
 
   User commands:
      ccl / collectcl / collectcontents / collectcontentslines
