pt / pausetask                Pauses a task
 
   Format:
      ;pt <task>              Pauses <task>
      ;pt -a                  Pauses all current tasks
 
   Notes:
      <task> can be any Axmud built-in or external task that's currently 
         running.
      <task> can be in the form of a task's label (e.g. 'stat, 'status'), its
         formal name (e.g. 'status_task') or the task's unique name (e.g. 
         'status_task_4').
      (Use the ';listtasklabel' command to list all task labels.)
      If there is more than one task matching <task>, they will all be paused.
 
      ';pausetask' sets a task's status to 'paused'. When the task resumes, its
         status is returned to the state it was in before it was paused 
         (usually, but not necessarily, 'active').
      Use ';resumetask' (with no arguments) to resume only tasks that were 
         paused with ';pausetask', and use ';resumetask all' to resume all
         tasks.
