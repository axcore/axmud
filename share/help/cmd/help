h / help                      Shows help for client commands

   Format:
      ;h <command>            Shows detailed help for <command>

      ;h                      Lists all client commands
      ;h -d                   Shows client commands available after disconnect
      ;h -s                   Displays a short list of client commands

   Notes:
      <command>, if specified, can be any client command (in its standard form)
         or any user command.
      Many client commands aren't available at all after a disconnection (though
         they are still available in 'connect offline' mode). Commands that are
         still available are generally only those ones which display
         information; after a disconnection, you can't change Axmud's internal
         data.
      When disconnected, you can see which commands are available by typing
         ';help' without any switches; you can force this behaviour (even when
         connected) by using the '-d' switch.
      The '-s' shows each client command in its standard form and the shortest
         corresponding user command.
      See also the help for ';hint', ';quickhelp' and ';searchhelp'.

   User commands:
