sfw / setfavouriteworld       Sets the list of favourite worlds

   Format:
      ;sfw <list>             Sets the list
      ;sfw                    Resets the list

   Notes:
      Axmud's connections window displays a list of world profiles, sorted in
         order of frequency, with the most-visited world highest on the list.
      However, you can specify one or more 'favourite worlds' which are
         automatically promoted to the top of the list. The first world in the
         list is automatically selected, which means you can connect to the
         world with a single keypress.
      The worlds in <list> don't actually have to exist; you can specify
         'deathmud' even if you haven't created a world profile with that name
         yet. If you later create a world profile called 'deathmud', it will
         automatically appear near the top of the connection window's list.
         However, any items in <list> which aren't valid world names (or which
         are duplicates) will be ignored.
      If you omit <list>, the list of favourite worlds is emptied.
