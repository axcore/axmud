dsm / deletesmiley            Deletes a smiley used by the Chat task

   Format:
      ;dsm <smiley>           Deletes a smiley

   Notes:
      For the benefit of Axmud users under the age of ten, the Chat task
         automatically converts smileys such as :) and ;) into colourful icons
         (unless this behaviour has been turned off by using the
         ';chatsetsmiley off' command).
      This command deletes a smiley from Axmud's list of smileys.
      Diamond brackets are disabled for this command, so you don't have to worry
         about enclosing any smileys which use the characters (, ), < or >.

   User commands:
      dsm / delsmiley / deletesmily / deletesmiley
