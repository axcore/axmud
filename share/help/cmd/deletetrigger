dtr / deletetrigger           Deletes a trigger
 
   Format:
      ;dtr <switches>         Deletes a trigger
 
   Notes:
      Triggers are one of five types of Axmud interface (the others being
         aliases, macros, timers and hooks).
      Triggers allow you to react automatically to text received from the world.
         The reaction can have one of two forms: the trigger can execute an 
         instruction (including world commands, forced world commands, client 
         commands, echo commands, Perl commands, script commands and multi
         commands), or it can change the way the received text is displayed in 
         the 'main' window. The latter is called a 'rewriter' trigger.
      This command deletes an existing 'inactive' trigger (one associated with a 
         particular profile) and its corresponding 'active' trigger, if there 
         is one.
      It's not possible to delete an active trigger directly; enable or disable 
         the trigger using ';modifytrigger' to set its 'enabled' attribute 
         instead.

      To delete the inactive trigger (and the active trigger based on it, if 
         there is one), one of the following (group 1) switch options must be 
         used:
         <name>               - Deletes trigger belonging to the current world
         <name> -w            - Deletes trigger belonging to the current world
         <name> -g            - Deletes trigger belonging to the current guild
         <name> -r            - Deletes trigger belonging to the current race
         <name> -c            - Deletes trigger belonging to the current char
         <name> -x <category> - Deletes trigger belonging to the current custom
                                   profile <category>
         <name> -d <prof>     - Deletes trigger belonging to the profile named
                                   <prof>
 
   User commands:
      dtr / deltrig / deltrigger / deletetrig / deletetrigger
