saw / setautoworld            Sets the list of auto-connecting worlds

   Format:
      ;saw                    Resets the list
      ;saw <world>            Adds a world to the list
      ;saw <world> <chars>    Adds a world to the list with characters

   Notes:
      Axmud can be set to auto-connect to one or more worlds when it starts.
      One way to do this is from the command line. Depending on your operating
         system, you might type one of these:

         perl axmud.pl
         ./axmud.pl

      Visually-impaired users would type one of these:

         perl baxmud.pl
         ./baxmud.pl

      You can add arguments to any of these commands. These arguments can be in
         one of these forms:

         <host> <port>
         <host>
         <world profile name>

      Alternatively, you can use this command. Axmud stores a list of worlds to
         which it should auto-connect. This list is only used when none of the
         command-line arguments described just above are usd.
      Axmud's list is emptied if you don't specify <world>. Otherwise, a new
         entry is added to the list.
      Each entry consists of a world profile name, and optionally one or more
         character profile names.
      Axmud won't connect to a world with the same character more than once, and
         it will ignore any world or character profiles that don't exist.

      Here is an example list, created with multiple uses of ';setautoworld':

         deathmud bilbo
         deathmud gandalf
         deathmud frodo sauron gandalf
         boringmud
         boringmud

      If 'boringmud' exists, Axmud creates six connections. If it doesn't exist,
         it creates only four. (Note that the duplicate 'gandalf' character is
         not used.)
      To see the current list, use the ';listautoworld' command.

   User commands:
      saw / setautoworld
