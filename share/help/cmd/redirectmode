rdm / redirectmode            Turns redirect mode on/off
 
   Format:
      ;rdm <string>           Turns on redirect mode
      ;rdm                    Turns off redirect mode
 
   Notes:
      You can use this command to turn on 'redirect mode', which automatically 
         converts commands like 'north' into 'sail north', or 's' into 'sail s'.
      <string> is a string in the form 'sail @'. Every occurence of the '@' 
         character is replaced by the direction of the move. 
      <string> can also be a sequence of commands such as '@;dig;get treasure'. 
         If <string> contains any spaces, it should be enclosed within diamond 
         brackets <..>

      By default, redirect mode works on any world command that looks like a 
         direction, including all the directions stored in the current 
         dictionary as well as the names of any exits in the automapper's 
         current room. The ';setredirectmode' command allows you to be more 
         specific about which kinds of directions should be converted.
      Redirect mode takes priority over assisted moves.

   User commands:
      rdm / redirect / redirectmode
