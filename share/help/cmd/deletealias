dal / deletealias             Deletes an alias

   Format:
      ;dal <switches>         Deletes an alias

   Notes:
      Aliases are one of five types of Axmud interface (the others being
         triggers, macros, timers and hooks).
      Aliases allow you to define shortcuts for world commands and to have those
         commands modified before being sent to the world.
      This command deletes an existing 'inactive' alias (one associated with a
         particular profile) and its corresponding 'active' alias, if there is
         one.
      It's not possible to delete an active alias directly; enable or disable
         the alias using ';modifyalias' to set its 'enabled' attribute instead.

      To delete the inactive alias (and the active alias based on it, if there
         is one), one of the following (group 1) switch options must be used:
         <name>               - Deletes alias belonging to the current world
         <name> -w            - Deletes alias belonging to the current world
         <name> -g            - Deletes alias belonging to the current guild
         <name> -r            - Deletes alias belonging to the current race
         <name> -c            - Deletes alias belonging to the current char
         <name> -x <category> - Deletes alias belonging to the current custom
                                   profile <category>
         <name> -d <prof>     - Deletes alias belonging to the profile named
                                   <prof>
