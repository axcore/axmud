db / displaybuffer            Shows the status of the session's display buffer
 
   Format:
      ;dbtb                     Shows buffer status
 
   Notes:
      The display buffer is Axmud's record of text received from the world and
         displayed in its default tab. (Text received from the world but 
         displayed in a different window pane, or a different window altogether,
         is not stored in the buffer.) 
      Every 'line' in the buffer corresponds to a single line of received text,
         and each session has its own display buffer.

      This command shows basic information about the buffer. To show the 
         buffer's contents, use the ';dumpdisplaybuffer' command.
 
   User commands:
      db / dispbuff / displaybuffer
