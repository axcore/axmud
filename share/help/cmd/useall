uall / useall                 Performs action on all unprotected objects
 
   Format:
      ;ula <command>          Use <command> with all unprotected objects
 
   Notes:
      <command> should be a string like 'put @ in pocket'.
      Every occurence of the '@' character in <command> is replaced by an
         unprotected object in the character's inventory; for example:
            > put gold in pocket
            > put cracked teacup in pocket
            > put rocket in pocket
      If the '@' character occurs nowhere in <command>, the command is simply 
         repeated once for every unprotected object.

      This command can only be used when the Inventory task is active. 
      For more information about protected objects, see the help for the
         ';protectobject' command.
 
   User commands:
      uall / useall
