lws / listworkspace           Lists all workspaces
 
   Format:
      ;lws                    Lists all workspaces

   Notes:
      Axmud supports multiple desktops or 'workspaces'. Workspaces can be both
         real and virtual. If you have multiple physical monitors, each one is a
         workspace. If your computer has a workspace switcher, allowing you to 
         switch between virtual desktops, each one is a workspace too.
      This command lists workspaces, both those which Axmud is using, and those
         Axmud is not currently using (but are available). 
      The workspace in which Axmud starts is the default workspace. Axmud uses 
         its own numbering system for workspaces, which might not match the 
         system's numbering system. In Axmud's numbering system, the default
         workspace is #0.
      Use the ';useworkspace' and ';removeworkspace' commands to change the 
         workspaces that Axmud is using right now. The default workspace cannot
         be removed.

      To modify which workspaces Axmud uses when it starts, see the help for
         ';addinitialworkspace'.
