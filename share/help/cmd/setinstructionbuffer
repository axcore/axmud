sib / setinstructionbuffer    Sets the size of instruction buffers
 
   Format:
      ;sib <size>             Sets the buffer <size>
      ;sib                    Sets the buffer size to 1000
 
   Notes:
      Instruction buffers are Axmud's records of processed instructions (see the
         help for ';instructionbuffer').
      Every session has its own instruction buffer, storing instructions 
         processed by that session. There is also a combined instruction buffer
         storing instructions processed by all sessions.

      All instruction buffers have the same size, which can be changed with this
         command. If specified, <size> must be an integer in the range 
         10-1000000.

   User commands:
      sib / setinstructbuff / setinstructionbuffer
