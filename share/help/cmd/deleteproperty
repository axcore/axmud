dp / deleteproperty           Deletes a profile template property
 
   Format:
      ;dp <template> <property>
               Deletes the template <property>
 
   Notes:
      The blueprint for a new category of profile is called a profile template. 
         Several custom profiles can be based on a single template.
      This command removes a property from the blueprint (a property can be used
         interchangeably with the terms 'instance variable' and 'IV').
      The operation will fail if a property named <property> doesn't exist, or
         if <property> is one of a small number of reserved property names.
      (See the help for ';listprofile' for more information about profiles.)
