miw / modifyinitialworkspace  Modifies an initial workspace
 
   Format:
      ;miw <num> <zonemap>    Modifies workspace <num> to use default <zonemap>
      ;miw <num>              Resets the zonemap on workspace <num>

   Notes:
      Axmud supports multiple desktops or 'workspaces'. Workspaces can be both
         real and virtual. If you have multiple physical monitors, each one is a
         workspace. If your computer has a workspace switcher, allowing you to 
         switch between virtual desktops, each one is a workspace.
      Use the ';listinitialworkspace' command to get a list of initial 
         workspace <num>bers.
      If you specify a <zonemap>, that zonemap is used as the default zonemap
         for the workspace. If not, Axmud selects a default zonemap.
      See also the help for ';addinitialworkspace'.

   User commands:
      miw / modiw / modifyinitialworkspace
