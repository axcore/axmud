swd / setworkspacedirection   Sets the way in which new workspaces are used
 
   Format:
      ;swd                    Shows the current setting
      ;swd -l                 Move left from the default workspace
      ;swd -r                 Move right from the default workspace
      ;swd -b                 After the default workspace, start from the left
      ;swd -e                 After the default workspace, start from the right

   Notes:
      Axmud supports multiple desktops or 'workspaces'. Workspaces can be both
         real and virtual. If you have multiple physical monitors, each one is a
         workspace. If your computer has a workspace switcher, allowing you to 
         switch between virtual desktops, each one is a workspace.
      The workspace in which Axmud starts is the 'default workspace'. If 
         additional workspaces are required, this command sets how Axmud selects
         them.
      
         -l  - Move left from the default workspace until reaching the far left
                  (and then stop)
         -r  - Move right from the default workspace until reaching the far
                  right (and then stop)
         -b  - After the default workspace, use the first available workspace on
                  the far left, then move right
         -e  - After the default workspace, use the first available workspace on
                  the far right, then move left
