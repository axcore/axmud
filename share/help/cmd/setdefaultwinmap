sdw / setdefaultwinmap        Sets default winmap for 'main'/'internal' windows
 
   Format:
      ;sdw                    Shows current default winmaps
      ;sdw -a <name>          Sets default winmap for 'main' windows
      ;sdw -d <name>          Sets default winmap for 'main' windows
      ;sdw -g <name>          Sets default winmap for other 'internal' windows
      ;sdw -r                 Resets default winmaps
 
   Notes:
      Winmaps are a plan for arranging the layout of 'internal' windows 
         (consisting of all 'main' windows, 'protocol' windows such as those 
         created by MXP, and 'custom' windows such as task windows).
      See the help for ';addwinmap' for more information about winmaps.

      When windows are arranged on a workspace grid (see the help for 
         ';activategrid'), they are arranged according to a plan called a 
         zonemap (see the help for ';addzonemap'). Zones within the zonemap are 
         able to specify which winmaps should be used for windows opened in that
         zone. If not, you can use this command to set a default winmap.
      There are three default winmaps: one for 'main' windows when workspace
         grids are activated (use the -a switch), another for 'main' windows
         when workspace grids are not activated (use the -d switch), and one for 
         other kinds of 'internal' window ('protocol' windows such as those 
         created by MXP, and 'custom' windows such as task windows - use the -g
         switch).
      <name>, if specified, is the name of the winmap to use.
