lip / listinitialplugin       Lists initial plugins

   Format:
      ;lip                    Lists plugins

   Notes:
      Axmud plugins are Perl modules which allow you to extend Axmud's core
         functionality with new tasks, client commands, cages, 'edit' windows
         and menu items, all of them integrating seemlessly with the existing
         Axmud code.
      This command lists the Axmud plugins which are loaded automatically when
         Axmud starts.
      See the help for ';loadinitialplugin' for more information about Axmud
         plugins.

   User commands:
      lip / listinitialplugin
