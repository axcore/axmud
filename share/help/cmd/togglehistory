tgh / togglehistory           Toggles collection of a world's connection history

   Format:
      ;tgh                    Toggles history collection

   Notes:
      Axmud is able to store basic details about past connection to a world.
      This command turns the collection of connection histories for all worlds
         on and off. Only future connections are affected; Axmud will continue
         collecting (or not collecting) information about existing connections.
      See also the help for ';showhistory' and 'clearhistory'.
