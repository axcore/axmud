liw / listinitialworkspace    Lists initial workspace settings
 
   Format:
      ;liw                    Lists settings

   Notes:
      Axmud supports multiple desktops or 'workspaces'. Workspaces can be both
         real and virtual. If you have multiple physical monitors, each one is a
         workspace. If your computer has a workspace switcher, allowing you to 
         switch between virtual desktops, each one is a workspace.
      This command lists which workspaces Axmud uses when it starts, and which
         zonemaps are used as the default zonemap in each workspace.

   User commands:
      liw / listiw / listinitialworkspace
