ecs / editcolourscheme        Opens an 'edit' window for a colour scheme

   Format:
      ;ecs <name>             Edits the colour scheme <name>

   Notes:
      A textview is a scrolling area of a window where text is displayed. A
         colour scheme determines the colours and font used in the textview.
      The colour scheme used in windows normally depends on the winmap (see the
         help for ';addwinmap'). The winmap is applied when a window is created,
         but then ignored. If you modify an existing colour scheme, the changes
         won't be applied to all windows automatically.

   User commands:
      ecs / editscheme / editcolorscheme / editcolourscheme
