edp / editpainter             Opens an 'edit' window for the world model painter
 
   Format:
      ;edp                    Edits the world model painter
  
   Notes:
      Rooms in the world model use 'room flags' to distinguish between different
         types of rooms. In the automapper window, a room's colour depends on 
         its room flags.
      As the character moves around the world, the world model painter 
         automatically sets room flags for the current room, which 'paints' that
         room a certain colour.
