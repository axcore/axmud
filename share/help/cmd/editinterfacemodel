eim / editinterfacemodel      Opens an 'edit' window for an interface model
 
   Format:
      ;eim -t                 Edits the trigger interface model
      ;eim -a                 Edits the alias interface model

   Notes:
      Axmud interfaces are triggers, aliases, macros, timers and hooks. 
      Interface models contain default settings for interfaces; this command
         lists some of those settings.
      As well as the switches above, the words 'trig', 'trigger', 'alias',
         'macro', 'timer' and 'hook' can be used.
