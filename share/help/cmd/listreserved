lrd / listreserved            Lists all reserved names

   Format:
      ;lrd                    Lists reserved names

   Notes:
      Reserved names are a list of words that can't be used as names for
         profiles, dictionaries, and so on.
      An operation like ';addworld name' will fail because the word 'name' is
         itself a reserved name.

   User commands:
      lrd / listrd / listreserved
