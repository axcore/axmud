asm / addsmiley               Adds a smiley for use with the Chat task
 
   Format:
      ;asm <smiley> <path>    Adds a smiley
 
   Notes:
      For the benefit of Axmud users under the age of ten, the Chat task 
         automatically converts smileys such as :) and ;) into colourful icons
         (unless this behaviour has been turned off by using the 
         ';chatsetsmiley off' command).
      If you're not satisfied with Axmud's built-in list of smileys, you can add
         your own with this command. <smiley> is the smiley itself which 
         shouldn't be longer than eight characters. <path> is the full path to
         the file which contains the icon.
      Diamond brackets are disabled for this command, so you don't have to worry
         about enclosing any smileys which use the characters (, ), < or >.

   User commands:
      asm / addsmily / addsmiley
