ccp / clonecustomprofile      Clones a custom profile
 
   Format:
      ;ccp <original> <copy>
               Clones the custom profile <original> into one named <copy>
 
   Notes:
      Besides having a guild profile and a race profile, characters can have any 
         number of custom profiles marked as a current profile.
      This operation clones the profile and all its associated cages, including 
         all the interfaces stored in the cages.
      Profile names must be no longer than 16 characters, contain only A-Z, a-z, 
         underlines and 0-9 (not the first character) and not be one of Axmud's 
         reserved names (see the ';listreserved' command). Non-Latin alphabets
         are acceptable.
      The operation will fail if a profile called <copy> already exists, or if
         one named <original> doesn't exist.
 
   User commands:
