   Notes:
      The world model stores information about the regions, rooms, characters
         and objects in the game world. The automapper window uses the model to
         display its maps.
      The world model can also keep track of minions - non-player characters
         which are controlled directly by players.

      Minion objects are treated a little differently to other model objects.
         The world model stores a collection of strings which the world uses to
         describe a minion. The world might use more than one string for the
         same minion, so you can use this command to add multiple minion
         strings, each of which corresponds to a single minion - for example,
         you might add 'smelly orc', 'hairy orc' and 'big ugly orc'.
      If you want to associate a minion string with a minion object in the world
         model, you can do so; that minion object can then be edited in the
         usual way. However, sometimes you'll only need Axmud to remember that
         certain strings refer to one of your minions.

      If you use the '-a' switch, a new string corresponding to a new minion
         object is added to the world model.
      If you use the '-m' switch, a new string corresponding to an existing
         minion object is added to the world model. <number> is the model number
         of the existing minion object.
      If you don't specify '-a' or '-m', only the minion string itself is added
         to the world model.

      You can also specify that a minion is owned by another player by using the
         '-o' switch. Otherwise, the world model will assume that the minion is
         controlled by you.
      If <string> contains spaces, it must be enclosed within diamond brackets
         <...>. Minion strings are case-insensitive.
