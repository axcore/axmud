mrp / modelreport             Compiles a report on the world model
 
   Format:
      ;mrp                    Shows a general report
      ;mrp <switch options>   Shows a more detailed report
 
   Notes:
      The world model stores information about the regions, rooms, characters
         and objects in the game world. The automapper window uses the model to
         display its maps.
      This command generates a statistical report on the world model, helping 
         you to keep track of various kinds of things, as well as checking for 
         things that still need to be done while compiling your maps.

      <switch options> can be used as follows:
         ;mrp                    - General report
         ;mrp -r <region>        - Report on <region>
 
         ;mrp -v                 - Report on visits in all regions
         ;mrp -v -r <region>     - Report on visits in <region>
         ;mrp -v -c <character>  - Report on <character> visits in all regions
         ;mrp -v -c <character> -r <region>
                                 - Report on <character> visits in <region>
 
         ;mrp -g                 - Report on guilds in all regions
         ;mrp -g -r <region>     - Report on guilds in <region>
         ;mrp -g -n <guild>      - Report on <guild>s in all regions
         ;mrp -g -r <region> -n <guild>
                                 - Report on <guild>s in <region>
 
         ;mrp -f                 - Report on room flags in all regions
         ;mrp -f -r <region>     - Report on room flags in <region>
         ;mrp -f -l <flag>       - Report on <flag>s in all regions
         ;mrp -f -r <region> -l <flag>
                                 - Report on <flag>s in <region>

         ;mrp -m                 - Report on room titles/descrips in all regions
         ;mrp -m -r <region>     - Report on rooms in <region> 
 
         ;mrp -x                 - Report on exits in all regions
         ;mrp -x -r <region>     - Report on exits in <region>    

         ;mrp -q                 - Quick report on the current region
 
      Switches can't be combined except in these formats above. However, the 
         switches -r, -c, -n and -l can be used multiple times in the same 
         command, so both of the following commands are valid:
 
         ';mrp -v -c gandalf -r forest'
         ';mrp -v -c gandalf -c bilbo -r forest -r mountains -r desert'
 
      If region names contain spaces, they should be enclosed by diamond
         brackets <...>.
