drn / deleteregion            Deletes a world model region
 
   Format:
      ;drn <number>           Deletes the region <number>
      ;drn <name>             Deletes the region <name>
 
   Notes:
      The world model stores information about the regions, rooms, characters
         and objects in the game world. The automapper window uses the 
         information stored in the world model to draw its maps.
      This command deletes the region along with all of its rooms and any other
         child objects. Any labels on the regionmap are also deleted. However,
         any child regions are not deleted.

   User commands:
