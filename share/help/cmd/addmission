amn / addmission              Adds a new mission using the current recording
 
   Format:
      ;amn <name>             Adds a new mission called <name>
      ;amn <name> <descrip>   Adds mission <name> with description <descrip>
 
   Notes:
      New missions can be created by using recordings. See the help for the
         ';record' command for information about making recordings.
      This command adds a new mission using the contents of the current
         recording. If the recording is still in progress, the mission is still
         created (and the recording will continue as normal).
      Missions are stored in the current world profile. Mission names must be no
         longer than 16 characters, contain only A-Z, a-z, underlines and 0-9 
         (not the first character) and not be one of Axmud's reserved names (see 
         the ';listreserved' command).
      If you specify <descrip>, make sure you enclose it with diamond brackets
         e.g. ';addmission test <Just a little test mission>'
      See the help for ';startmission' for more information about missions.
