tpl / testplugin              Tests an Axmud plugin
 
   Format:
      ;tpl <path>             Tests a plugin in the file <path>
      ;tpl                    Tests a plugin stored in Axmud's data directory
      ;tpl -s                 Tests a standard plugin
 
   Notes:
      Axmud plugins are Perl modules which allow you to extend Axmud's core 
         functionality with new tasks, client commands, cages, 'edit' windows 
         and menu items, all of them integrating seemlessly with the existing 
         Axmud code.
         
      This command tests an Axmud plugin without loading it. (A plugin will not 
         load at all if it contains an incorrect header or if there are errors 
         in the Perl code).
      If you specify <path>, it should be the full file path to the plugin.
         Otherwise, you will be prompted to choose a plugin to load.
      Axmud provides a number of standard plugins, and if you specify the '-s'
         switch you'll see the directory (folder) where standard plugins are
         stored. Otherwise you'll see the directory where plugins you write
         youself can be stored.

      See the help for ';loadplugin' for more information about Axmud plugins.
