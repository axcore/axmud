dcb / dumpcommandbuffer       Displays contents of a world command buffer
 
   Format:
      ;dcb -s                 Shows most recent world command in session buffer
      ;dcb                    
      ;dcb -s <number>        Shows command <number>
      ;dcb <number>
      ;dcb -s <start> <stop>  Shows commands between <start> and <stop>
      ;dcb -s <start> <stop> 

      ;dcb -c                 Shows most recent world command in combined buffer
      ;dcb -c <number>        Shows command <number>
      ;dcb -c <start> <stop>  Shows command between <start> and <stop>
 
   Notes:
      World command buffers are Axmud's records of individual commands sent to 
         the world (see the help for ';commandbuffer').
      Every session has its own world command buffer, storing world commands 
         sent by that session. There is also a combined world command buffer
         storing world commands sent by all sessions.

      If specified, <number>, <start> and <stop> must be valid item numbers 
         within the buffer. If the buffer is full, the earliest items are 
         deleted to make room for new ones. Use the ';commandbuffer' command to
         get the current bounds of the buffer.
      <number>, <start> and <stop> can be replaced by the words 'start'/'first'
         (for the first item in the buffer) and 'stop'/'last' (for the last
         item) - e.g. ';dcb start', ';dcb 34 stop', ';dcb first last'
      <number> can be replaced with the word 'all' - e.g. ';dcb all' (which is
         the same as ';dcb start stop').
      If the line numbers are specified in the wrong order, e.g. ';dcb 40 30' or
         ';dcb stop start', the contents of the buffer will be listed in reverse
         order.
