apl / applycolourscheme       Applies a colour scheme to 'internal' windows

   Format:
      ;apl <name>             Applies a colour scheme <name>
      ;apl <name> <switches>  Applies the colour scheme to certain windows

   Notes:
      A textview is a scrolling area of a window where text is displayed. A
         colour scheme determines the colours and font used in the textview.
      The colour scheme used in windows normally depends on the winmap (see the
         help for ';addwinmap'). The winmap is applied when a window is created,
         but then ignored. If you modify an existing colour scheme, the changes
         won't be applied to all windows automatically.

      You can use this command to apply a colour scheme to 'internal' windows,
         replacing the colour scheme they're currently using. ('Internal'
         windows include 'main' windows, all 'protocol' windows such as those
         created by MXP and all 'custom' windows such as task windows).
      Other types of window are not affected by this command. In addition, some
         'internal' windows (such as the Status task window) operate in
         monochrome mode and don't use colour schemes at all.
      If you merely want to update a window with a colour scheme you've
         modified, use the ';updatecolourscheme' command.

      If specified, <switches> consists of one or more switch options:

         -m             - Apply to 'main' windows
         -p             - Apply to 'protocol' windows
         -c             - Apply to 'custom' windows
         -s             - Apply to this session's 'internal' windows
         -w <number>    - Apply to 'grid' window <number>

      If you don't specify any <switches>, the colour scheme is applied to all
         'internal' windows.
      The confirmation messages shows how many windows were potentially
         affected. This number depends on how many windows existed and which
         <switches> were specified; it doesn't show how many textviews had their
         colours/fonts updated.
