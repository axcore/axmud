cch / clonechar               Clones a character profile
 
   Format:
      ;cch <original> <copy>
               Clones the character profile <original> into one named <copy>
 
   Notes:
      This operation clones the character and all its associated cages, 
         including all the interfaces stored in the cages.
      Profile names must be no longer than 16 characters, contain only A-Z, a-z, 
         underlines and 0-9 (not the first character) and not be one of Axmud's 
         reserved names (see the ';listreserved' command). Non-Latin alphabets
         are acceptable.
      The operation will fail if a profile called <copy> already exists or if
         <copy> is an invalid name.
