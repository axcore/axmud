sg / setguild                 Sets the current guild
 
   Format:
      ;sg <name>              Sets the current guild profile to <name>
 
   Notes:
      This command sets the current guild profile for this session.
      If a profile named <name> doesn't already exist, it is created. If the
         profile already exists, it is made the current guild profile.
      The current character profile will also be informed of the change.
      Profile names must be no longer than 16 characters, contain only A-Z, a-z, 
         underlines and 0-9 (not the first character) and not be one of Axmud's 
         reserved names (see the ';listreserved' command).
      The operation will fail if <name> is invalid or if there is no current
         character (use the ';setchar' command to set one first).
