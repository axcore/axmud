umo / unmonitorobject         Removes objects monitored by the Condition task

   Format:
      ;umo <number>           Removes monitored object <number>

   Notes:
      The Condition task is able to monitor the condition of objects in your
         character's inventory (at least, those which have been detected by the
         Inventory task, which must also be running). The idea is to alert you
         to possessions which need to be repaired or replaced.
      By default, all objects in your character's inventory are monitored;
         however, if you use the ';monitorobject' command to create one or more
         monitored objects, only those objects will be monitored.
      This command removes an object from the current character's list of
         monitored objects. Use the ';listmonitorobject' command to get a
         numbered list of monitored objects.

   User commands:
      umo / unmonitor / unmonitorobj / unmonitorobject
