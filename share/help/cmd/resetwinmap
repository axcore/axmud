rwm / resetwinmap             Resets a winmap
 
   Format:
      ;rwm <name>             Resets the winmap <name>
 
   Notes:
      Winmaps are a plan for arranging the layout of 'internal' windows 
         (consisting of all 'main' windows, 'protocol' windows such as those 
         created by MXP, and 'custom' windows such as task windows).
      See the help for ';addwinmap' for more information about winmaps.

      The winmap consists of two parts: a list of strip objects, and a list of
         table objects. 
      This command only empties the list of table objects. (Actually, it empties
         the list of winzones. Each winzone is an area available to be occupied 
         by a single table object).
      To modify the list of strip objects or to modify other winmap properties, 
         use the ';modifywinmap' command. To manipulate winzones directly, see
         the help for ';addwinzone'.
 
   User commands:
      rwm / resetwm / resetwinmap
