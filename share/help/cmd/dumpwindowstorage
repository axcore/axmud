dws / dumpwindowstorage       Displays stored 'grid' window sizes/positions
 
   Format:
      ;dws                    Displays stored sizes/positions
 
   Notes:
      The workspace grid is an invisible grid, spanning the whole available
         workspace, on which Axmud tries to arrange its windows so that they 
         don't overlap (as far as possible).
      Only 'grid' windows (including the 'main' window, task windows and the 
         automapper window) are arranged on the workspace grid. Temporary 
         windows, including the object viewer window and all edit, preference,
         wizard and dialogue windows, are not affected.

      Workspace grids are not available on all systems, and can be turned off on
         all systems (using ';disactivategrid').
      When workspace grids are turned off, new windows are created using a
         default size and position. 
      In that situation, you can use the ';togglewindowstorage' command to store
         the size and position of all 'grid' windows. The next time the same
         window is opened (either in a new session, or when you restart Axmud),
         it's created using the same size and position.
      This command shows a list of stored sizes/positions.

      See also the help for ';applywindowstorage' and ';dumpwindowstorage'.
