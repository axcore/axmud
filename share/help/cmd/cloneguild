cg / cloneguild               Clones a guild profile

   Format:
      ;cg <original> <copy>
               Clones the guild profile <original> into one named <copy>

   Notes:
      This operation clones the guild and all its associated cages, including
         all the interfaces stored in the cages.
      Profile names must be no longer than 16 characters, contain only A-Z, a-z,
         underlines and 0-9 (not the first character) and not be one of Axmud's
         reserved names (see the ';listreserved' command). Non-Latin alphabets
         are acceptable.
      The operation will fail if a profile called <copy> already exists or if
         <copy> is an invalid name.

   User commands:
      cg / copyguild / cloneguild
