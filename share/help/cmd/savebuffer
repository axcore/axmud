svb / savebuffer              Saves display/command buffers to file
 
   Format:
      ;svb                    Saves the whole of both buffers
      ;svb <switches>         Saves part of the buffers
 
   Notes:
      The display buffer is Axmud's record of any text received from the world 
         which was displayed in the session's default tab (see the help for 
         ';displaybuffer'). The world command buffer is Axmud's record of
         individual commands sent to the world. (See the help for
         ';displaybuffer' and ';commandbuffer').
      This command saves the contents of one or both buffers, in whole or in 
         part, to a buffer file. Later, when connected in 'offline' mode, the 
         buffer file can be loaded with the ';loadbuffer' command and replayed, 
         as if still connected to the world, with the ';replaybuffer' command.
      (A replay can be halted with the ';replaybuffer' command.)

      If specified, <switches> can be one or more of the following switch
         options, in any order:
            -d          Save the display buffer
            -c          Save the world command buffer
            -b <time>   Save the buffer(s), beginning at the <time>
            -e <time>   Save the buffer(s), ending at the <time>
      If neither -d nor -c are specified, both buffers are saved. If neither -b
         or -e are specified, the whole buffer is saved.
      You can use the ';dumpdisplaybuffer' and ';dumpcommmandbuffer' commands to
         get the <time>s you need.
      Buffer files are saved in the 'buffers' data sub-directory. It's safe to
         edit buffer files manually to remove any lines you don't want.
