twc / testwindowcontrols      Finds the size of window controls

   Format:
      ;twc                    Tests window controls on the default workspace
      ;twc <number>           Tests window controls on workspace <number>

   Notes:
      Window controls are the borders around the edges of all windows on the
         desktop. Axmud needs to know their sizes to get its window positioning
         right.
      This command tries to detect the size of window controls. If a workspace
         <number> isn't specified, the test is performed on the default
         workspace (the one in which Axmud opened - use ';listworkspace' to get
         a list of workspaces.)
      If the test is successful, those details are used when positioning windows
         on that workspace. (If you prefer, you can specify fixes window
         controls sizes using the ';setwindowcontrols' command; these sizes
         override the sizes detected by any test.)
      If the test fails, Axmud will use a set of default window controls sizes.

      Window controls sizes are tested automatically when Axmud first runs, and
         whenever Axmud starts using a new workspace (see the help for
         ';useworkspace'), so you'll probably only need to use this command if
         you change your desktop theme (or if you use the ;setwindowcontrols'
         command).
      See also the help for ';listwindowcontrols'.
