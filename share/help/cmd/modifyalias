mal / modifyalias             Modifies an alias
 
   Format:
      ;mal <switches>         Modifies an alias
 
   Notes:
      Aliases are one of five types of Axmud interface (the others being 
         triggers, macros, timers and hooks).
      Aliases allow you to define shortcuts for world commands and to have those
         commands modified before being sent to the world.
      This command modifies the attributes of an existing 'inactive' alias (one
         associated with a particular profile) and its corresponding 'active'
         alias, if there is one. 
      It's also possibly to modify the active alias directly, in which case, the
         changes won't apply to the parent inactive alias (and will only last 
         for the session, or until the active alias is deleted).

      <switches> allows you to define which alias (and which of its attributes)
         should be modified.

      To modify the active alias directly, one of the following (group 0) switch 
         options must be used:
         -i <name>            - Modifies the active alias <name>
         -i <number>          - Modifies the active alias <number>
      However, to modify the inactive alias (and the active alias based on it, 
         if there is one), one of the following (group 1) switch options must 
         be used instead:
         <name>               - Modifies alias belonging to the current world
         <name> -w            - Modifies alias belonging to the current world
         <name> -r            - Modifies alias belonging to the current race
         <name> -g            - Modifies alias belonging to the current guild
         <name> -c            - Modifies alias belonging to the current char
         <name> -x <category> - Modifies alias belonging to the current custom
                                   profile <category>
         <name> -d <prof>     - Modifies alias belonging to the profile named
                                   <prof>

      One or more of the following group 2/3 switch options must be used.
      Group 2 switch options: 
         -s <pattern>         - Modifies the 'stimulus' attribute (a regex)
         -p <substitution>    - Modifies the 'response' attribute (a Perl
                                   substitution)   
      Group 3 switch options: 
         -e <boolean>         - Modifies the 'enabled' attribute (1 or 0) 
         -o <boolean>         - Modifies the 'ignore_case' attribute (1 or 0)
         -k <boolean>         - Modifies the 'keep_checking' attribute (1 or 0)
         -t <boolean>         - Modifies the 'temporary' attribute (1 or 0, 
                                   default is 0)
      N.B. The 'name' attribute can't be modified.

      Group 4 switch options (only modify the inactive alias, so can't be used
         with the -i switch):
         -b <name>            - This alias is checked before aliases called
                                   <name> (when they both become active)
         -y <name>            - This alias is not checked before aliases called 
                                   <name> (when they both become active)
         -f <name>            - This alias is checked after aliases called 
                                   <name> (when they both become active)
         -z <name>            - This alias is not checked after aliases called 
                                   <name> (when they both become active)

   General interface notes:
      If <instruction>, <pattern>, <string> or <substitution> contain 
         whitespace, they must be enclosed by diamond brackets
         
            e.g. <You see (.*) exits>
            
      <boolean> can be typed as 1 or 0, or any word beginning with t, T, f or F
