cname / chatsetname           Sets your chat nickname

   Format:
      ;cname <name>           Sets your nickname to <name>
      ;cname                  Uses the current character as your nickname

   Notes:
      The Chat task is used to chat with other players directly via telnet.
         Calls can be placed (or accepted) with any user whose MUD client uses
         the zChat or MudMaster protocols.
      This command changes your chat nickname. All current chat sessions are
         updated and the <name> is stored so that it will be available in future
         sessions. If you don't specify a <name>, the current character's name
         will be used instead.
      <name> must be between 3 and 16 characters.

   User commands:
