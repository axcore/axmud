tws / togglewindowstorage     Toggles storage of 'grid' window sizes/positions

   Format:
      ;tws                    Toggles storage on/off

   Notes:
      The workspace grid is an invisible grid, spanning the whole available
         workspace, on which Axmud tries to arrange its windows so that they
         don't overlap (as far as possible).
      Only 'grid' windows (including the 'main' window, task windows and the
         automapper window) are arranged on the workspace grid. Temporary
         windows, including the data viewer window and all edit, preference,
         wizard and dialogue windows, are not affected.

      Workspace grids are not available on all systems, and can be turned off on
         all systems (using ';disactivategrid').
      When workspace grids are turned off, new windows are created using a
         default size and position.
      In that situation, you can use this command to store the size and position
         of all 'grid' windows. The next time the same window is opened (either
         in a new session, or when you restart Axmud), it's created using the
         same size and position.
      On MS WIndows, window storage is turned on by default. On other systems,
         it's turned off by default.

      For a list of stored sizes/positions, use the ';dumpwindowstorage'
         command. To store window sizes/positions just once, use
         ';applywindowstorage'. To reset stored positions, see the help for the
         ';clearwindowstorage' command.
