iti / importtimer             Imports timer(s) from the interface clipboard

   Format:
      ;iti <name> <switches>  Imports the timer called <name>
      ;iti <switches>         Imports all clipboard timers

   Notes:
      Timers are one of five types of Axmud interface (the others being
         triggers, aliases, macros and hooks).
      Timers allow you to execute an instruction repeatedly at fixed intervals,
         and also to specify an instruction to be executed later.
      This command provides a simple way to copy macros from one profile/cage
         to another (perhaps even in a different world, in a different session).
         Having 'exported' the macro to Axmud's interface clipboard using the
         ';importmacro' command, that macro can then be 'imported'.
      Note that the contents of the clipboard are not saved. Note also that the
         timer's attributes might change while stored in the clipboard. In other
         words, it's up to you to perform the export, then the import, before
         doing anything else.
      If an active timer was exported, an inactive timer is imported. The
         imported timer will not replace an existing timer with the same name.

      <switches> allows you to specify which profile's timer cage should
         receive the imported timers. One of the following (group 1) switches
         may be specified:
         (no switch)   - Imports timer(s) to the current world
         -w            - Imports timer(s) to the current world
         -r            - Imports timer(s) to the current race
         -g            - Imports timer(s) to the current guild
         -c            - Imports timer(s) to the current char
         -x <category> - Imports timer(s) to the current custom profile
                            <category>
         -d <prof>     - Imports timer(s) to the profile named <prof>
