aqs / addquest                Adds a new quest

   Format:
      ;aqs <name>
               Adds a new quest named <name>
      ;aqs <name> <switches>
               Adds a new quest and sets its contents

   Notes:
      Axmud is able to store information about the current world's quests.
         Quests created with this command are stored in the current world
         profile.
      Quest names must be no longer than 16 characters, contain only A-Z, a-z,
         underlines and 0-9 (not the first character) and not be one of Axmud's
         reserved names (see the ';listreserved' command). Non-Latin alphabets
         are acceptable.
      It's possible to link a quest to a mission (see the help for
         ';startmission' for more information about missions).

      If you don't specify <switches>, an empty quest will be created; you can
         sets its contents later with the ';modifyquest' command.
      Otherwise, <switches> can include any of the following switch options:
         -m <mission>   - Sets the corresponding mission
         -p <number>    - Sets how many quest points are earned from this quest
         -x <number>    - ...and how much XP (if applicable)
         -c <number>    - ...and how much cash (if applicable)
      <number> can be any number, including negative numbers (in case there is
         some kind of penalty associated with completing the quest). The default
         value is 0, meaning that no quest points/XP/cash are earned.

      <switches> can also include any of these switch options, repeated as often
         as you like:
         -s <line>      - Adds a line to the quest's solution list. The whole
                             line must be enclosed by diamond brackets <...>
         -t <comment>   - Adds a comment to the quest's comment list. The whole
                             comment must be enclosed by diamond brackets <...>
