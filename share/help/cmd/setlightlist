sll / setlightlist            Sets the list of recognised light status values
 
   Format:
      ;sll <list>             Sets a new light status list
      ;sll                    Shows the current light status list

   Notes:
      Worlds will often present different verbose room descriptions, depending
         on the time of day in the game world and how much light is illuminating
         the character's location.
      Axmud represents current conditions with a 'light status' (stored in the 
         world model). There are three standard values for the light status
         ('day', 'night' and 'dark'). These three values are always available;
         in addition, you can use this command to add new values.
      Rooms in the world model can store multiple verbose descriptions, each 
         matching a recognised light status. When a new room is created, the
         verbose description (if any) is marked as belonging to Axmud's current 
         light status (the default value is 'day').

      Each item in <list> must be no longer than 16 characters, and contain only
         A-Z, a-z, underlines and 0-9 (not the first character). Non-Latin
         alphabets are acceptable.
      Repeating items in <list> are ignored. The world model's list of light
         status values always contains 'day', 'night' and 'dark', so there is no
         need to specify them.
      To reset the list of light status values, use ';resetlightlist'. To set a
         new value for the current light status, use ';setlightstatus'.
