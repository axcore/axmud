dzm / deletezonemap           Deletes a zonemap
 
   Format:
      ;dzm <name>             Deletes the zonemap <name>
 
   Notes:
      Zonemaps are a plan for arranging windows on a workspace grid. Zonemaps
         contain one or more zone models, describing a region of the workspace 
         and the kinds of window that region is allowed to contain.
      Axmud provides a number of standard zonemaps which can't be deleted. In
         addition, the zonemap can't be deleted if it's in use by any workspace 
         grid.
      The zonemap can be deleted if it is merely the default zonemap for one or
         more workspaces, but is not use by a workspace grid. In that case,
         Axmud selects a new default zonemap for the workspace(s).
