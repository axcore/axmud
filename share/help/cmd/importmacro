ima / importmacro             Imports macro(s) from the interface clipboard

   Format:
      ;ima <name> <switches>  Imports the macro called <name>
      ;ima <switches>         Imports all clipboard macros

   Notes:
      Macros are one of five types of Axmud interface (the others being
         triggers, aliases, timers and hooks).
      Macros allow you to specify instructions to be executed automatically when
         a certain key (or combination of keys) is pressed.
      This command provides a simple way to copy macros from one profile/cage
         to another (perhaps even in a different world, in a different session).
         Having 'exported' the macro to Axmud's interface clipboard using the
         ';importmacro' command, that macro can then be 'imported'.
      Note that the contents of the clipboard are not saved. Note also that the
         macro's attributes might change while stored in the clipboard. In other
         words, it's up to you to perform the export, then the import, before
         doing anything else.
      If an active macro was exported, an inactive macro is imported. The
         imported macro will not replace an existing macro with the same name.

      <switches> allows you to specify which profile's macro cage should
         receive the imported macros. One of the following (group 1) switches
         may be specified:
         (no switch)   - Imports macro(s) to the current world
         -w            - Imports macro(s) to the current world
         -r            - Imports macro(s) to the current race
         -g            - Imports macro(s) to the current guild
         -c            - Imports macro(s) to the current char
         -x <category> - Imports macro(s) to the current custom profile
                            <category>
         -d <prof>     - Imports macro(s) to the profile named <prof>
