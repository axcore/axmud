ft / freezetask               Freezes (or unfreezes) the current tasklist

   Format:
      ;ft                     Freezes (or unfreezes) tasks

   Notes:
      ';freezetask' prevents the task loop from running, so all tasks are
         actually frozen - unlike ';pausetask', which changes the status of
         individual tasks to 'paused'.

   User commands:
