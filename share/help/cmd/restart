res / restart                 Restarts suspended Axmud internal processes
 
   Format:
      ;res                    Restarts suspended processes
 
   Notes:
      Axmud is written in the Perl language. If the code generates a Perl error, 
         Axmud suspends its internal processes. Doing this prevents users from 
         seeing the same error message again and again, and potentially protects
         stored data from getting corrupted.
      Most errors of this kind are caused by invalid patterns (regular
         expressions) in interfaces (triggers, aliases, macros, timers and
         hooks). You can often correct them by opening an 'edit' window and by
         replacing the invalid pattern with a valid one or by deleting it
         altogether.
      Sometimes the error is caused by faulty code in your plugins or 
         (occasionally) in Axmud itself. Faulty plugins can be disabled with the
         ';disableplugin' command. Problems with the Axmud code should be 
         reported to the authors.
      This command restarts suspended processes, which often returns Axmud to a
         more-or-less functional state. If not, you should should shut down
         Axmud and restart it.

   User commands:
