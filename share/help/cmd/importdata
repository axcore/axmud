imd / importdata              Imports an object (or objects)

   Format:
      ;imd                    Imports a partial data file
      ;imd <path>             Imports the specified partial data file

   Notes:
      Axmud uses a fixed directory structure for its data files. Sometimes it's
         convenient to move data files somewhere else - for backup purposes, or
         to transfer them to another computer.
      ';exportfiles' can export a whole file (or files), but sometimes you'll
         only want to export a single thing - a single dictionary, or a single
         zonemap. ';exportdata' can do this.
      ';importdata' imports the data from any file created with the
         ';exportdata' command. <path>, if specified, should be the full path
         to the exported file.

   User commands:
      imd / importdata
