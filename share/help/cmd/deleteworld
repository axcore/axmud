dw / deleteworld              Deletes a world profile
 
   Format:
      ;dw <name>              Deletes the world profile <name>
 
   Notes:
      This operation deletes not only the world, but all its associated guild,
         race, character and custom profiles, their cages, any associated
         profile templates and the world model. (However, no dictionaries are
         deleted.)
      The operation will fail if <name> is the current world in any session.
 
   User commands:
      dw / delworld / deleteworld
