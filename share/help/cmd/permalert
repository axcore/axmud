palt / permalert              Tells an initial task to automatically read alerts
 
   Format:
      ;palt <attribute>
      ;palt <attribute> <value>
                              Tells a task to read aloud an alert

      ;palt                   Get a list of available <attribute>s
 
   Notes:
      Tasks have various text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities, but some tasks don't
         use TTS at all. The ';read', ';switch' and ';alert' commands allow you 
         to interact with the TTS capabilities of currently-running tasks. 
      The ';permread', ';permswitch' and ';permalert' commands allow you to 
         interact with the TTS capabilities of tasks in the global initial
         tasklist - the tasks which start, every time you connect to a world - 
         as well as any currently-running tasks.
      To modify the way that tasks process speech in general, use the ';speech'
         and ';editconfig' commands. TTS for tasks is turned off, by default, so
         you won't hear anything until you turn it on with the ';speech' 
         command.

      The ';alert' and ';permalert' commands are both in the same format:
 
         ;alert <attribute> <value>
         ;permalert <attribute> <value>

      For example, both ';alert health down 20' and ';permalert health down 20' 
         will instruct the current Status task to read alound an alert when your
         character's health points fall to 20%. (The two words 'health down' 
         count as a single <attribute>.)
      If you want this setting to last for the rest of the session, you should
         use the ';alert' command. However, if you want the setting to be used 
         for this and all future sessions, you should use the ';permalert' 
         command, which stores the setting in both the current Status task, and 
         in the Status task stored in the global initial tasklist (if any).
      If you use ';permalert' and never use ';alert', you can be sure that both
         the current and initial tasks have the same TTS settings.


      If you don't specify an <attribute> at all, a list of available attributes
         will be displayed. See the help for ';alert' for a full list of 
         attributes used with Axmud's built-in tasks.
