es / editscript               Opens an Axbasic script for editing
 
   Format:
      ;es                     Edits the script in the file test.bas
      ;es <script>            Edits the script in the file <script>.bas
 
   Notes:
      Axbasic is Axmud's own scripting language, based on the original Dartmouth
         BASIC and the later implementation by the same authors, True BASIC.
      As well as standard BASIC keywords and intrinsic (built-in) functions,
         Axbasic provides a number of keywords and functions especially designed
         to interact with the world and with Axmud's stored data. Use the 
         ';axbasichelp' command for a list of keywords and functions.

      This command opens a file containing an Axbasic script in a text editor.

      When Axmud wants to load an Axbasic script, it checks a list of 
         directories (called 'folders' on MS Windows systems), one at a time, 
         until it finds a script with the right name. The first directory in the 
         list is always the standard 'scripts' sub-directory, but the rest of 
         the list is customisable (see the help for ';adddirectory'). 
      <script> should match the name of at least one file in these directories
         (without their .bas extensions).
