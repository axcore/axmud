tmd / testmodel               Performs an integrity check on the world model
 
   Format:
      ;tmd                    Performs the integrity check
      ;tmd -f                 Performs the integrity check and fixes conflicts
 
   Notes:
      This is a debug command. It can be used to detect conflicts (errors) in 
         the world model caused by unresolved Axmud issues. If the check detects 
         any errors of this kind, please report them to the authors.
      Some (but not all) errors will be auto-fixed if you use the -f switch.
      Very large maps can take several seconds to check, so it is advisable to 
         use this command only in 'offline' mode. If you use the -f switch, you
         should use this command a second time, because fixing an error may 
         enable a different kind of error to be detected.
