euw / emptyunknownwords       Empties the collection of unrecognised words
 
   Format:
      ;euw                    Empty the list
 
   Notes:
      Axmud dictionaries contain lists of words, classified according to their
         type; this helps Axmud to interpret text received from the world.
      Whenever a line containing a list of objects is parsed, any words which
         aren't recognised by the current dictionary can be stored there in a
         special collection. 
      This command empties the collection, discarding all the words Axmud hasn't 
         been able to parse.
