echo / echo                   Displays an echo string as a system message

   Format:
      ;echo <string>          Displays the <string>

   Notes:
      Echo commands can be typed in the 'main' window's command entry box. These
         commands start with the echo sigil, a double quote character:

         "Hello world!

      Everything after the sigil is displayed as a system message in the
         session's default tab (in its 'main' window).

      Echo sigils are turned off by default (use ';togglesigil -e' to turn them
         on again). However, this client command is always available, and you
         don't need to type the sigil:

         ;echo Hello world!

      If you want to preserve spacing between words, you can enclose the whole
         <string> in diamond brackets <...>:

         ;echo <Hello...      world!>

   User commands:
      echo
