k / kill                      Attacks target(s) in the current room

   Format:
      ;k                      Attacks the first NPC in the room
      ;k <target>             Attack a single <target>
      ;k <target_list>        Attacks the whole <target_list>

   Notes:
      ';kill' attacks the first non-player target in the room suggested by the
         Locator task. Axmud uses the 'kill' command specified by the current
         world's command cages. If the world uses a verb other than 'kill', you
         should update the command cages before using this command.

      <target> must be a singular noun or adjective. To attack a 'big guard',
         you can use the command ';kill guard' or ';kill big'; but you can't use
         the command ';kill guards'.
      However, <target> can be the words 'all' or 'mall' (or the equivalent in
          the current world). 'all' normally means all creatures except your
          character (and any minions your character controls). 'mall' normally
          means every being that's not a player character (PC).

      <target_list> should be a list of singular nouns and adjectives. To attack
         'a big guard and a hairy orc', you could use the commands
         ';kill guard orc', ';kill big hairy', ';kill guard hairy' or
         ';kill big orc'.
      One target will be attacked for every noun or adjective in <target_list>.
         The commands ';kill guard guard orc' and ';kill big big hairy' will
         both attack exactly two big guards and one hairy orc, regardless of how
         many guards, orcs, big things or hairy things there are in the room.

      'all' overrides every other <target>, and 'mall' overrides every target
         except 'all'. So, the command ';kill gandalf mall' will attack all NPCs
         in the room, but it won't attack a player-controlled character called
         Gandalf.

      ';kill' can only be used to attack things Axmud knows to be a character,
         minion, sentient or creature. You can't ';kill door', even if the world
         allows you to 'kill door' as a way of breaking down a door; you can't
         use ';kill bear' if Axmud doesn't know that 'bear' is a living being.
       If you don't specify a <target> at all, this command will attack the
         first NPC, ignoring any player characters in the room. If you specify a
         target, it can be either a player or non-player character.
