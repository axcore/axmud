mqs / modifyquest             Modifies an existing quest

   Format:
      ;mqs <name> <switches>  Modifies the quest called <name>

   Notes:
      Axmud is able to store information about the current world's quests. You
         can use this command to modify the quest's contents.

      <switches> can include any of the following switch options:
         -m <mission>   - Sets the corresponding mission
         -p <number>    - Sets how many quest points are earned from this quest
         -x <number>    - ...and how much XP (if applicable)
         -c <number>    - ...and how much cash (if applicable)
      <number> can be any number, including negative numbers (in case there is
         some kind of penalty associated with completing the quest). The default
         value is 0, meaning that no quest points/XP/cash are earned.
      If <mission> or <number> are omitted, those components are set to their
         default values.

      <switches> can also include any of these options, repeated as often as you
         like:
         -s <line>      - Adds a line to the quest's solution list. The whole
                             line must be enclosed by diamond brackets <...>
         -t <comment>   - Adds a comment to the quest's comment list. The whole
                             comment must be enclosed by diamond brackets <...>
      If <line> is omitted, all lines in the solution list are deleted. If
         <comment> is omitted, all lines in the comment list are deleted. Once
         deleted, you can specify more lines, e.g.

            ';modifyquest -s -s <A brand new line to replace the old ones>'
