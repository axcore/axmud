rrs / renameregionscheme      Renames a region colour scheme

   Format:
      ;rrs <old> <new>        Renames the scheme <old> as <new>

   Notes:
      A region colour scheme defines a set of colours for one or more regions.
         The automapper window uses these colours when it draws the region(s).
      <old> is the name of an existing region colour scheme (use
         ';listregionscheme' to get a list of them).
      <new> is the scheme's new name. <name> can be any text (maximum 16
         characters).
      If either <old> or <new> contain spaces, you should enclose the name in
         diamond brackets <...>.
      The default colour scheme cannot be renamed.
