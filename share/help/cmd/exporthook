xhk / exporthook              Exports a hook to the interface clipboard

   Format:
      ;xhk <switches>         Exports a hook

   Notes:
      Hooks are one of five types of Axmud interface (the others being triggers,
         aliases, macros and timers).
      Hooks allow you to specify instructions to be executed automatically when
         certain events happen.
      This command provides a simple way to copy hooks from one profile/cage to
         another (perhaps even in a different world, in a different session). It
         'exports' the hook to Axmud's interface clipboard, from where it can be
         'imported'.
      Note that the contents of the clipboard are not saved, when Axmud saves
         its files. Note also that the hook's attributes might change while
         stored in the clipboard. In other words, it's up to you to perform the
         export, then the import, before doing anything else.
      You can repeat this command as often as you like, to add multiple hook
         to the clipboard, before importing them all together with
         ';importhook'. Use ';emptyclipboard' when you want to start afresh.
         Note that 'Export' buttons in preference/edit windows empty the
         clipboard, before adding one or interfaces to it.
      Both active and inactive hooks can be exported.

      <switches> allows you to define which hook (and which of its attributes)
         should be exported.

      To export an active hook directly, one of the following (group 0) switch
         options must be used:
         -i <name>            - Exports the active hook <name>
         -i <number>          - Exports the active hook <number>
      However, to export an inactive hook, one of the following (group 1)
         switch options must be used instead:
         <name>               - Exports hook belonging to the current world
         <name> -w            - Exports hook belonging to the current world
         <name> -r            - Exports hook belonging to the current race
         <name> -g            - Exports hook belonging to the current guild
         <name> -c            - Exports hook belonging to the current char
         <name> -x <category> - Exports hook belonging to the current custom
                                   profile <category>
         <name> -d <prof>     - Exports hook belonging to the profile named
                                   <prof>
