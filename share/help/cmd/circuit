cct / circuit                 Moves the character along a circuit route

   Format:
      ;cct <start> <name>     Moves from the room <start> along the route <name>
      ;cct <name>             Moves from the current room along the route <name>

   Notes:
      Axmud pre-defined routes are an easy way to move between rooms in the
         world (see the help for ';addroute' for information about routes).
      This command moves the character along a circuit route, which starts and
         stops at the room whose room tag is <start>. The circuit route itself
         is called <name>.
      If the Locator task already knows the current room's tag (i.e. if you can
         see the tag in the task window), you can omit <start>.

      See also the help for the ';go', ';drive', ';road' and ';quick' commands.
