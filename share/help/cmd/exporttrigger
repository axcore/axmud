xtr / exporttrigger           Exports a trigger to the interface clipboard

   Format:
      ;xtr <switches>         Exports a trigger

   Notes:
      Triggers are one of five types of Axmud interface (the others being
         aliases, macros, timers and hooks).
      Triggers allow you to react automatically to text received from the world.
         The reaction can have one of three forms: the trigger can execute an
         instruction (including world commands, forced world commands, client
         commands, echo commands, Perl commands, script commands and multi
         commands) or it can split a line into two (a 'splitter' trigger), or it
         can change the way the received text is displayed in the 'main' window
         (a 'rewriter' trigger).
      This command provides a simple way to copy triggers from one profile/cage
         to another (perhaps even in a different world, in a different session).
         It 'exports' the trigger to Axmud's interface clipboard, from where it
         can be 'imported'.
      Note that the contents of the clipboard are not saved, when Axmud saves
         its files. Note also that the trigger's attributes might change while
         stored in the clipboard. In other words, it's up to you to perform the
         export, then the import, before doing anything else.
      You can repeat this command as often as you like, to add multiple triggers
         to the clipboard, before importing them all together with
         ';importtrigger'. Use ';emptyclipboard' when you want to start afresh.
         Note that 'Export' buttons in preference/edit windows empty the
         clipboard, before adding one or interfaces to it.
      Both active and inactive triggers can be exported.

      <switches> allows you to define which trigger (and which of its
         attributes) should be exported.

      To export an active trigger directly, one of the following (group 0)
         switch options must be used:
         -i <name>            - Exports the active trigger <name>
         -i <number>          - Exports the active trigger <number>
      However, to export an inactive trigger, one of the following (group 1)
         switch options must be used instead:
         <name>               - Exports trigger belonging to the current world
         <name> -w            - Exports trigger belonging to the current world
         <name> -r            - Exports trigger belonging to the current race
         <name> -g            - Exports trigger belonging to the current guild
         <name> -c            - Exports trigger belonging to the current char
         <name> -x <category> - Exports trigger belonging to the current custom
                                   profile <category>
         <name> -d <prof>     - Exports trigger belonging to the profile named
                                   <prof>

   User commands:
