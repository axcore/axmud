mcf / modifyconfig            Modifies text-to-speech configurations
 
   Format:
      ;mcf                    Shows a list of text-to-speech configurations
      ;mcf <name>             Shows settings stored in the configuration <name>
      ;mcf <name> <options>   Modifies the text-to-speech configuration <name>

   Notes:
      If you have one or more of the text-to-speech engines installed on your
         system, Axmud can use them to convert text to speech. The engines 
         currently supported are eSpeak, Flite, Festival and Swift. (Axmud also 
         uses a dummy engine, called 'none'. If Axmud tries to convert text to 
         speech using the dummy engine, you'll hear nothing.)
      Axmud stores a number of TTS configurations. Each configuration stores an 
         engine, voice, word speed, word rate, word pitch and volume setting, 
         among others. Text received from the world uses one configuration, 
         system messages use another, so it's easy to customise the 
         configurations so that they read aloud in different voices.
      You can use this command to modify the settings stored in the 
         configuration called <name>. You can then use the ';speak' command to 
         test the new configuration, if you want. (See also the help for 
         ';addconfig', ';cloneconfig', ';deleteconfig' and ';listconfig'. The 
         command ';editconfig' opens a GUI window, from which you can also 
         modify the configuration.)
      Note that the configurations called 'espeak', 'flite', 'festival', 'swift' 
         and 'none' can't be modified (but other configurations using these 
         engines can be modified.)

      Unfortunately, some engines don't allow us to modify some <options> (for
         example, you can't use this command to change the word speed used with
         Flite; eSpeak uses a word speed, whereas Festival uses a word rate.)
      If you specify an invalid <option>, it is ignored (and text-to-speech
         conversion happens using default values).
      See the documentation for your preferred text-to-speech engine to find out
         which voices are available on your system.   

      If specified, <options> should be one of the following:

         engine <string>      Sets the TTS engine to <string>, which must be one 
                                 of the following strings: 'espeak', 'flite', 
                                 'festival', 'swift' or 'none'.

         voice <string>       Sets the voice to <string> (eSpeak, Festival and 
                                 Swift only). You can use any <voice> available
                                 on your system. See the documentation for your 
                                 preferred text-to-speech engine to find out 
                                 which voices are available on your system. 
         voice                Resets the voice (a default value is used).

         speed <num>          Sets the word speed to <num> (eSpeak only). Must 
                                 be in the range 10 - 200.
         speed                Resets the word speed (a default value of 150 
                                 words per minute is used).

         rate <num>           Sets the word rate to <num> (Festival and Swift 
                                 only). Must be in the range 0.5 - 2.
         rate                 Resets the word rate (a default value of 1 is 
                                 used).

         pitch <num>          Sets the word pitch to <num> (eSpeak and Swift 
                                 only). For eSpeak, must be in the range 0 - 99.
                                 For Swift, must be in the range 0.1 - 5.
         pitch                Resets the pitch (a default value is used, 50 for
                                 eSpeak, 1 for Swift).

         volume <num>         Sets the volume to <num> (Swift only). Must be in
                                 the range 0.33 - 6.
         volume               Resets the volume (a default value of 1 is used).

         use <pattern>        Adds an exclusive pattern. If one or more 
                                 exclusive patterns have been added, only lines 
                                 which match one of those patterns are converted 
                                 to speech; otherwise, all received lines are 
                                 converted to speech
         use                  Resets the list of exclusive patterns

         exclude <pattern>    Adds an excluded pattern. If a line matches an 
                                 excluded pattern, it is not converted to speech 
                                 (but otherwise, it is.) Excluded patterns are 
                                 ignored completely if you have added one or 
                                 more exclusive patterns
         exclude              Resets the list of excluded patterns
 
      Normal Axmud switches can be used, if you prefer: -e for engine, -v for 
         voice, -s for speed, -r for rate, -p for pitch, -l for volume, -u for 
         use and -x for exclude.
