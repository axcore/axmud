abu / autobackup              Configures settings for auto-backups
 
   Format:
      ;abu                    Displays current auto-backup settings
      ;abu <switches>         Modifies auto-backup settings
 
   Notes:
      Axmud stores all of its data files in a single directory (folder).
      The ';backupdata' command makes a backup copy of this directory. This
         command automates that process, creating a backup file at regular
         intervals.
      To restore data files from a backup file, see the help for the
         ';restoredata' command.

      Auto-backups are turned off, by default. To turn them on using default
         settings (one backup per week, done when Axmud is shutting down, and
         the user is prompted to choose a directory each time), you can use this
         command:

            ;autobackup -p

      For any other behaviour, you can specify <switches>, which are one or more
         of the switch options below in any order. You must not specify more
         than one switch option from each group:

      Group 1:

            -n          - Don't perform auto-backups (default)
            -a          - Perform auto-backup whenever Axmud starts
            -p          - Perform auto-backup whenever Axmud shuts down
            -x          - Perform auto-backup at regular intervals, done when
                            Axmud starts
            -y          - Perform auto-backup at regular intervals, done when
                            Axmud shuts down

      Group 2:

            -f <dir>    - Set the directory where the backup file is stored.
                             <dir> should be the full directory path
            -o          - Reset the directory, so the user is prompted to choose
                             one for every auto-backup (default)
                             
      Group 3:
            -i <days>   - Sets the interval, in days, between auto-backups. The
                             interval is only used when performing auto-backups
                             at regular intervals (i.e. if you've specified the
                             -x or -y switch). <days> must be an integer in the
                             range 0-365. 1 means 'backup every day', 8 means
                             'backup every week', 366 means 'backup every year'.
                             If you use 0, Axmud will temporarily stop
                             performing auto-backups (but will remember when the
                             last auto-backup was performed, so when you change
                             the interval again, the interval is calculated from
                             that date). The default interval is 8

      Group 4:
            -d          - Use the default file type for the backup file - .tgz
                             for Linux, .zip for MS Windows (default)
            -t          - Use .tar for the backup file
            -z          - Use .zip for the backup file

      Group 5:
            -a          - Append a time (as well as a date) to the backup file
            -e          - Only append the date to the backup file (default)
