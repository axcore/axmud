lpn / listpanel               Lists workspace panel (taskbar) sizes
 
   Format:
      ;lpn                    List panel sizes
 
   Notes:
      Panels are the areas at the edge of the desktop (workspace) that aren't
         available to any window. Often, at least one panel has some kind of
         'start' menu, a list of windows and several other icons, such as one
         displaying the date and time.
      Custom panel sizes can be set with the ';setpanel' command. See also the
         help for ';testpanel'.

   User commands:
      lpn / listpn / listpanel
