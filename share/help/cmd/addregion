arn / addregion               Adds a region to the world model
 
   Format:
      ;arn <name>             Adds a new region <name>
      ;arn <name> -t

      ;arn <name> <parent>    Adds a new region belonging to a <parent> region
      ;arn <name> <parent> -t 
 
   Notes:
      The world model stores information about the regions, rooms, characters
         and objects in the game world. The automapper window uses the model to
         display its maps.
      Most model objects can be added with ';addmodelobject', but regions must 
         be added with this command.

      <name> and <parent> are the names of regions. If the region <parent> is 
         specified, the new region <name> will appear below it in the automapper
         window's list of regions.
      If the '-t' switch is specified, the new region will be a temporary region
         which will be deleted the next time Axmud starts.
      Region names are unique; the operation will fail if a region called <name>
         already exists, or if a specified region called <parent> does not.
      If <name> is longer than 32 characters, it is shortened.

   User commands:
