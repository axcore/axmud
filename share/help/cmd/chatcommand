ccm / chatcommand             Sends a remote command to chat contacts
 
   Format:
      ;ccm -n <name> <text>   Sends command to chat contacts called <name>
      ;ccm -g <group> <text>  Sends command to everyone in the <group>
      ;ccm <text>             Sends command to everyone
 
   Notes:
      The Chat task is used to chat with other players directly via telnet.
         Calls can be placed (or accepted) with any user whose MUD client uses
         the zChat or MudMaster protocols.
      This command is the equivalent of typing ';ccm <text>' in the relevant
         Chat task windows. Note that remote commands can only be sent in chat
         sessions using the zChat protocol. You'll get an error message if you 
         try to send them in a MudMaster session.
      If you want to preserve spacing in <text>, surround it with diamond
         brackets <...>, e.g.
         
         ';ccm <say hello       how  are  you>'
         
      The switches -n and -g can't be combined.
