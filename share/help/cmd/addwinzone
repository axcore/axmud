awz / addwinzone              Adds a new winzone
 
   Format:
      ;awz <name> <switches>  Adds a zone model to the winmap <name>
 
   Notes:
      Winmaps are a plan for arranging the layout of 'internal' windows 
         (consisting of all 'main' windows, 'protocol' windows such as those 
         created by MXP, and 'custom' windows such as task windows).
      See the help for ';addwinmap' for more information about winmaps.

      The winmap consists of two parts: a list of strip objects, and a list of
         table objects. 
      Table objects are arranged on a 60x60 table. The table is divided up into
        'winzones', with each winzone containing information about the type of
        table object that should be created there.
      
      This command adds a new winzone to the winmap called <name>, and 
         optionally sets the information stored there. Existing winzones can be
         modified with the ';modifywinzone' command.

      <switches> consist of some compulsory and some optional switch options.
      Compulsory switch options:
        -p <x coord> <y coord>  - Winzone's position (in blocks) on the table
        -s <width> <height>     - Winzone's size (in blocks) on the table
        -n <package>            - The package name of the table object to be
                                     created in this winzone, for example
                                     'Games::Axmud::Table::Pane'. The initial 
                                     'Games::Axmud::Table::' part can be 
                                     omitted, for example 'Pane'; note that 
                                     capitalisation must be preserved)
      Optional switch options:
        -o <name>               - A name to give to the table object, when it is
                                     created. Can be any string. If not
                                     specified, the table object's name is the 
                                     same as its number, so avoid using numbers.
                                     Max 16 characters
        -i <key>
        -i <key> <value>        - Adds an initialisation property, <key>, set to
                                     <value> (if specified). Initialisation 
                                     properties are passed to the table object
                                     when it is created. Any property not 
                                     specified here takes itse default value.
        -r <key>                - Removes the initialisation property <key>. 
                                     Notes that all -i switches are processed 
                                     before any -r switch is processed. The -i
                                     and -r switches can be used multiple times
                                     in one command
