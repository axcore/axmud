pro / prompt                  Replays the most recent prompt ignored by TTS

   Format:
      ;pro                    Reads aloud the most recent prompt

   Notes:
      When it's time for the user to type a command, some worlds send a
         command prompt full of statistics (often containing your character's
         health points, for example).
      These prompts take a long time to read aloud so, by default, Axmud doesn't
         convert them to speech. If you want to hear them, you can type
         ';speech prompt off'.
      This command reads aloud the most recent prompt, regardless of whether it
         was converted to speech, or not.
      When running the version of Axmud that's optimised for visually-impaired
         users, the end key can be used as a shortcut to this command (but only
         once Axmud is connected to a world, in online or offline mode.)

      This command works best with pre-configured worlds, which already contain
         a list of patterns matching the command prompts sent by the world. If
         not, you will have to add your own list of matching patterns.
