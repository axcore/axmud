ial / importalias             Imports alias(es) from the interface clipboard

   Format:
      ;ial <name> <switches>  Imports the alias called <name>
      ;ial <switches>         Imports all clipboard aliases

   Notes:
      Aliases are one of five types of Axmud interface (the others being
         triggers, macros, timers and hooks).
      Aliases allow you to define shortcuts for world commands and to have those
         commands modified before being sent to the world.
      This command provides a simple way to copy aliases from one profile/cage
         to another (perhaps even in a different world, in a different session).
         Having 'exported' the alias to Axmud's interface clipboard using the
         ';importalias' command, that alias can then be 'imported'.
      Note that the contents of the clipboard are not saved. Note also that the
         alias's attributes might change while stored in the clipboard. In other
         words, it's up to you to perform the export, then the import, before
         doing anything else.
      If an active alias was exported, an inactive alias is imported. The
         imported alias will not replace an existing alias with the same name.

      <switches> allows you to specify which profile's alias cage should
         receive the imported aliases. One of the following (group 1) switches
         may be specified:
         (no switch)   - Imports alias(es) to the current world
         -w            - Imports alias(es) to the current world
         -r            - Imports alias(es) to the current race
         -g            - Imports alias(es) to the current guild
         -c            - Imports alias(es) to the current char
         -x <category> - Imports alias(es) to the current custom profile
                            <category>
         -d <prof>     - Imports alias(es) to the profile named <prof>

   User commands:
