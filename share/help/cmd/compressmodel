cmd / compressmodel           Reduces amount of memory used by the world model

   Format:
      ;cmd                    Performs the compression operation

   Notes:
      Axmud attemps to minimise the amount of memory used by the world model, so
         that users who draw very large maps (many tens of thousands of rooms)
         don't find that they've run out of memory. This also reduces the size
         of the data file, which means that loading and saving large maps
         happens much more quickly.

      This command checks every room and exit in the world model, and tries to
         reduce the amount of memory used by each of them.
      In practice, unless you have recently removed a lot of data from the
         model, you probably won't notice any difference.
      For example, verbose room descriptions are collected by default and stored
         in the model, by default. If you remove them all, the amount of memory
         used by the world model is reduced. If you then use this command, the
         amount of memory is reduced again, because even an empty verbose
         description takes up (a little) memory.

      (To remove verbose room descriptions, open the automapper window and,
         from its menu, select 'Edit > Reset > Reset room data...')
