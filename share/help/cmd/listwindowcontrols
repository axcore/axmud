lwc / listwindowcontrols      Lists window controls sizes

   Format:
      ;lwc                    Lists custom window controls sizes

   Notes:
      Window controls are the borders around the edges of all windows on the
         desktop. Axmud needs to know their sizes to get its window positioning
         right.
      Custom window controls sizes can be set with the ';setwindowcontrols'
         command. See also the help for ';testwindowcontrols'.

   User commands:
      lwc / listwc / listcontrols / listwindowcontrols
