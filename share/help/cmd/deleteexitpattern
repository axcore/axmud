dep / deleteexitpattern       Deletes exit pattern from current world profile
 
   Format:
      ;dep <switch> <number>
               Deletes the exit pattern <number> of type <switch>
 
   Notes:
      The Locator task uses exit patterns, defined by the current world profile, 
         to spot when a character's attempts to move fail (or when the character 
         is moved involuntarily). 
      Because they also appear just after a character move, this command can 
         also be used to delete a dark room pattern or an unspecified room 
         pattern. (Unspecified room patterns match lines sent by the world when 
         the character has arrived in a new room for which the world hasn't sent
         a new room statement, as it normally would.)
 
      <switch> must be one of the following:
         -d   Deletes a door pattern, e.g. '^You bump into a door!'
         -l   Deletes a locked door pattern, e.g. '^It's locked!'
         -f   Deletes a failed exit pattern, e.g. '^You can't go that way!'
         -r   Deletes a dark room pattern, e.g. '^You can't see a thing!'
         -u   Deletes an unspecified room pattern, e.g. '^You land with a thump'
         -i   Deletes involuntary exit pattern, e.g. '^You run for your life!'
      <number> is the number of the pattern in the list displayed by the 
         ';listexitpattern' command. Once you delete one pattern, any remaining
         patterns are re-numbered.

      The Locator task must be reset (usually with the ';resetlocatortask'
          command) or restarted before your changes will take effect.
