luw / listunknownwords        Lists the collection of unrecognised words
 
   Format:
      ;luw                    Lists unrecognised words
 
   Notes:
      Axmud dictionaries contain lists of words, classified according to their
         type; this helps Axmud to interpret text received from the world.
      Whenever a line containing a list of objects is parsed, any words which
         aren't recognised by the current dictionary can be stored there in a
         special collection. 
      When you're ready to start adding new words to the dictionary (using the 
         ';addword' command), you can use this command to display a convenient 
         list of all the words Axmud hasn't been able to parse.
