   Notes:
      Dictionaries help Axmud to interpret the text it receives from the world.
      An Axmud dictionary stores groups of words. It contains a group of weapon
         words ('sword', 'mace', etc), a group of words for living beings
         ('orc', 'dwarf', etc), and several more besides.
      It also contains several useful terms, such as phrases for times of the
         day.

      Dictionary names must be no longer than 16 characters, contain only A-Z, 
         a-z, underlines and 0-9 (not the first character) and not be one of 
         Axmud's reserved names (see the ';listreserved' command).
