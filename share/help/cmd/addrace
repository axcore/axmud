ar / addrace                  Adds a race profile
 
   Format:
      ;ar <name>              Adds the race profile <name>
 
   Notes:
      Profile names must be no longer than 16 characters, contain only A-Z, a-z, 
         underlines and 0-9 (not the first character) and not be one of Axmud's 
         reserved names (see the ';listreserved' command). Non-Latin alphabets
         are acceptable.
      The operation will fail if a profile called <name> already exists or if
         <name> is invalid.
      To create a race profile and set it as the current race profile, use the
         ';setrace' command.
