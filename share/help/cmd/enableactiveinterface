eai / enableactiveinterface   Enables active interfaces
 
   Format:
      ;eai <name>             Enables active interface called <name>
      ;eai <number>           Enables active interface with <number>
      ;eai                    Enables all active interfaces
 
   Notes:
      Axmud interfaces are triggers, aliases, macros, timers and hooks. 
      Most interfaces are associated with a particular profile and are called
         'inactive' interfaces. When the profile becomes a current profile its
         interfaces become 'active' (except those whose name is the same as an 
         existing active interface associated with a higher-priority profile). 
      This command enables the active interface without making any changes to
         the corresponding inactive interface (if there is one). Use the 
         ';listactiveinterface' command to get a list of the <name> and <number>
         of all active interfaces.
