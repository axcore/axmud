tmw / togglemainwindow        Toggles special features of 'main' windows
 
   Format:
      ;tmw                    Shows current special features
      
      ;tmw -u                 Toggles 'main' window's urgency hint
      ;tmw -t                 Toggles tooltips in session's default tab
      
   Notes:
      This command enables or disables a couple of features used exclusively in
         'main' windows.
      The '-u' switch enables or disables the 'main' window's urgency hint. 
         When text is received from the world and the 'main' window is not on
         the user's current workspace, the window has its urgency hint set. On 
         many systems, the window will start flashing on the workspace panel 
         (taskbar). This won't happen if the urgency hint has been disabled with
         this command.
      The '-t' switch enables or disables tooltips in the session's default tab,
         meaning the area of the 'main' window where text received from the 
         world is displayed.
