cst / chatstopfile            Stops files transfers with chat contacts

   Format:
      ;cst -n <name>          Stops file transfers with contacts called <name>
      ;cst -g <group>         Stops file transfers with everyone in the <group>
      ;cst                    Stops file transfers with everyone

   Notes:
      The Chat task is used to chat with other players directly via telnet.
         Calls can be placed (or accepted) with any user whose MUD client uses
         the zChat or MudMaster protocols.
      This command is the equivalent of typing ';stopfile' in the relevant Chat
         task windows. It will halt any file transfers in progress.
      The switches -n and -g can't be combined.

   User commands:
      cst / stopfile / chatstopfile
