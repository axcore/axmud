srd / setredirectmode         Fine-tunes redirect mode
 
   Format:
      ;srd -p                 Converts only primary directions
      ;srd -b                 Converts both primary and secondary directions
      ;srd -a                 Converts all directions

      ;srd                    Shows redirect mode status
 
   Notes:
      Redirect mode automatically converts commands like 'north' into 'sail 
         north', or 's' into 'sail s'. Use the ';redirectmode' command to turn
         redirect mode on or off.
      By default, redirect mode works on any world command that looks like a 
         direction, including all the directions stored in the current 
         dictionary as well as the names of any exits in the automapper's 
         current room. This command allows you to be more specific about which 
         kinds of directions should be converted.
      Primary directions are the cardinal directions 'north', 'southwest' etc
         (including abbrevitions like 'n' and 'sw'), as well as 'up' and 'down'.
         Typical secondary directions include 'in', 'out', 'enter' and 'exit'.
