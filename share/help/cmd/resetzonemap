rzm / resetzonemap            Resets a zonemap

   Format:
      ;rzm <name>             Resets the zonemap <name>

   Notes:
      Zonemaps are a plan for arranging windows on a workspace grid. Zonemaps
         contain one or more zone models, describing a region of the workspace
         and the kinds of window that region is allowed to contain.
      This command resets the zonemap by removing its zone models (to create new
         zone models, see the for ';addzonemodel').
      Axmud provides a number of standard zonemaps which can't be reset. In
         addition, the zonemap can't be reset if it's in use by any workspace
         grid.

   User commands:
      rzm / resetzm / resetzonemap
