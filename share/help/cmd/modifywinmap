mwm / modifywinmap            Modifies an existing winmap

   Format:
      ;mwm <name> <switch> <arguments>
               Modifies a zone model <number> in the zonemap <name>

   Notes:
      Winmaps are a plan for arranging the layout of 'internal' windows
         (consisting of all 'main' windows, 'protocol' windows such as those
         created by MXP, and 'custom' windows such as task windows).
      See the help for ';addwinmap' for more information about winmaps.

      The winmap consists of two parts: a list of strip objects, and a list of
         table objects.
      This command only modifies the list of strip objects and other winmap
         properties. To modify table objects, see the help for ';resetwinmap',
         ';addwinzone' and so on.

      <switch> is one of the following switches, optionally followed by one or
         more <arguments>:

         -w <world> <world> ...
               - Sets the list of worlds which use this winmap as their default
                    winmap for 'main' windows
         -w    - Empties the list of worlds

         -o <orientation>
               - Sets the order in which strip objects are added to the window:
                    'top'    - added vertically, top to bottom (default)
                    'bottom' - added vertically, bottom to top
                    'left'   - added horizontally, left to right
                    'right'  - added horizontally, right to left

         -b <package>
               - Adds a strip object to the beginning of the list of strip
                    objects added to the window. <package> is the strip object's
                    package name, e.g. 'Games::Axmud::Strip::Entry' (but the
                    initial 'Games::Axmud::Strip::' part can be omitted, for
                    example just use 'Entry'; note that capitalisation must be
                    preserved)
         -b <package> <key> <value> <key> <value> ...
               - Adds a strip object to the beginning of the list, with a series
                    of initialisation properties, <key>, set to <value>. Any
                    property not specified here takes its default value
         -e <package>
               - Adds a strip object to the end of the list
         -e <package> <key> <value> <key> <value> ...
               - Adds a strip object to the end of the list, with a series of
                    initialisation properties (as described above)

         -l    - Shows a numerical list of each strip object and their
                    initialisation properties, if set
         -u <number>
               - Moves strip object <number> up one position in the list. If
                    it's already at the top, it remains there
         -d <number>
               - Moves strip object <number> down one position in the list. If
                    it's already at the bottom, it remains there
         -v <number>
               - Removes strip object <number> from the list

         -s <width> <height>
               - Standard size for adding new table objects to an existing
                    window. Should be a factor of the table size (i.e., for a
                    60x60 table, use 2/3/4/5/6/10/12/15/20/30/60). Default is
                    30x30
