ldb / loadbuffer              Loads display/command buffers from file

   Format:
      ;ldb <path>             Loads the specified buffer file
      ;ldb                    Loads a buffer file

   Notes:
      The display buffer is Axmud's record of any text received from the world
         which was displayed in the session's default tab (see the help for
         ';displaybuffer'). The world command buffer is Axmud's record of
         individual commands sent to the world. (See the help for
         ';displaybuffer' and ';commandbuffer').
      ';savebuffer' can save the contents of one or both buffers, in whole or in
         part, to a buffer file. Later, when connected in 'offline' mode, the
         buffer file can be loaded with this command and replayed, as if still
         connected to the world, with the ';replaybuffer' command.

      If specified, <path> should be the full path to the buffer file (which is
         normally stored in the 'buffers' data sub-directory). If you don't
         specify a <path>, you will be prompted to choose one.

   User commands:
      ldb / loadbuff / loadbuffer
