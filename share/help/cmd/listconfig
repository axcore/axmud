lcf / listconfig              Shows a list of text-to-speech configurations
 
   Format:
      ;lcf                    Lists configurations
 
   Notes:
      If you have one or more of the text-to-speech engines installed on your
         system, Axmud can use them to convert text to speech. The engines 
         currently supported are eSpeak, Flite, Festival and Swift. (Axmud also 
         uses a dummy engine, called 'none'. If Axmud tries to convert text to 
         speech using the dummy engine, you'll hear nothing.)
      Axmud stores a number of TTS configurations. Each configuration stores an 
         engine, voice, speed and pitch setting, among others. Text received 
         from the world uses one configuration, system messages use another, so 
         it's easy to customise the configurations so that they read aloud in  
         different voices.
      This command lists TTS configurations in a long format. Visually-impaired 
         users might prefer the list generated by the ';modifyconfig' command,
         used with no switches.
