lro / listroomcommand         Displays room command settings

   Format:
      ;lro                    Displays settings
      
   Notes:
      A few worlds (for example EmpireMUD) offer a series of commands in each
         room, which are specific to that room.
      Those commands can be put to use with the client commands ';roomcommand',
         ';ignoreroomcommand' and ';noticeroomcommand'.
      This command displays current room command settings - which room
         commands are available at the current location and which have been
         marked as ignorable.
 
   User commands:
      lro / listroom / listroomcmd / listroomcommand
