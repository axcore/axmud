dex / deleteexit              Deletes an exit from the exit model

   Format:
      ;dex <exit>             Deletes the exit number <exit>

      ;dex -t <exit>          Deletes both the exit and its twin
      ;dex <exit> -t

   Notes:
      The world model stores information about the regions, rooms, characters
         and objects in the game world. The automapper window uses the model to
         display its maps.
      This command deletes the exit whose model number is <exit>.
      Many exits have a twin exit, which leads from the exit's destination room
         back to the exit's own room, in the opposite direction. If the '-t'
         switch is specified, the twin exit (if any) is also deleted.

   User commands:
