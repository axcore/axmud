ssl / ssl                     Connects to an unnamed world via SSL

   Format:
      ;ssh <host> <port>      Connects to the world
      ;ssh <host>             Connects to the world using the generic port

   Notes:
      Axmud offers three types of connection to a world - ordinary telnet, SSH
         (Secure Shell) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).
      This command first creates a temporary world profile - which isn't saved,
         even if you use the ';save -f' command - and then connects to the
         specified world using the SSL protocol. The connection opens in a new
         'main' window (or in a new tab in a shared 'main' window).
      Most worlds won't accept connections using SSL, and some of those that do
         won't accept them from ordinary players. For those worlds, see the help
         for ';telnet' and ';ssh'.

   User commands:
      ssl
