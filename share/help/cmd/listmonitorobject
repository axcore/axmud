lmo / listmonitorobject       Lists objects monitored by the Condition task
 
   Format:
      ;lmo                    Displays the list
 
   Notes:
      The Condition task is able to monitor the condition of objects in your
         character's inventory (at least, those which have been detected by the
         Inventory task, which must also be running). The idea is to alert you
         to possessions which need to be repaired or replaced.
      By default, all objects in your character's inventory are monitored;
         however, if you use the ';monitorobject' command to create one or more 
         monitored objects, only those objects will be monitored.
      This command lists the monitored objects stored in the current character
         profile.
 
   User commands:
      lmo / listmo / listmonitor / listmonitorobject
