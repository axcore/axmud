The Chat task is an instant messenger service. It allows you to chat with
   other people using either the MudMaster of zChat protocols, both of which
   are widely used on other MUD clients.
The task is almost feature-complete, but note that encryption in zChat
   sessions has not yet been implemented.
The commands below can be entered in the 'main' window. A separate list of
   commands can be used in the task's own window, once it is open. Type 
   ';help' in that window to get a list of commands available there.
Some commands are available in MudMaster sessions or in zChat sessions, but
   not both. In general, zChat sessions offer a larger range of features.
If you experience problems connecting or receiving calls, you will probably
   need to adjust your firewall settings (which frequently interfere with
   instant messenger applications of this sort).
The Chat task cannot be started with ';starttask' - instead, use one of the
   commands below (such as ';listen' or ';chatcall'). In addition, the Chat
   task can't be used as an initial or custom task.
