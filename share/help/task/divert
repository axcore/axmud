The Divert task intercepts text received from the world and diverts it to the
   task's window.
The window usually changes colour for a few seconds to alert you that some
   text has been diverted. You'll also here one of Axmud's sound effects (if
   sound is turned on).
The Channels task performs a similar function, but using multiple tabs. You
   can't run both tasks at the same time.
 
Client commands used with this task are:
   ;addchannelpattern         Adds a Channels/Divert task pattern
   ;deletechannelpattern      Deletes Channels/Divert task patterns
   ;listchannelpattern        Lists Channels/Divert task patterns
   ;emptydivertwindow         Empties the Divert task window
