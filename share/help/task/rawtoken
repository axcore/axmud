The RawToken task is a debugging task. It displays all text received from the 
   world split into pieces, or 'tokens'. Newline characters and special 
   'escape sequence' codes that are normally invisible to the user count as
   single tokens, and are each displayed on a separate line.---
Tokens are colour-coded: newline character tokens are blue, escape character
   tokens (which don't start a recognised escape sequence) are yellow, escape
   sequences are cyan, MXP tokens are green, MXP element tokens are magenta
   and all other tokens (consisting of ordinary text) are white. Packet 
   numbers are displayed in red.
