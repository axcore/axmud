The Compass task opens a window with buttons that can be clicked in order to
   move around and attack things (for players who are allergic to keyboards).
The window also enables and disables a series of macros which allow you to
   send common commands using the keys on your keypad. The number keys are
   used to move around. The '+' key is used to go up and the '-' key is used
   to go down. The remaining keys are assigned to useful world commands like
   'inventory' and 'kill all'.
Let your mouse hover over the window buttons to see which command has been
   assigned to which key. You can't change the keys assigned to directions
   but you can easily change the commands assigned to the other keys.

Client commands used with this task are:
   ;compass                   Modifies the (current) Compass task
   ;permcompass               Modifies the current and initial Compass tasks
