The world profile stores a list of patterns. When text received from the world
   matches one of these patterns, it is redirected to the Channels task window
   (when the task is running).
Each pattern is also assigned a channel, each of which has its own tab in the
   task window.
The Divert task performs a similar function, but uses a single tab, with
   changes in the window's background colour indicating the channel. You can't
   run both tasks at the same time.

Client commands used with this task are:
   ;addchannelpattern         Adds a Channels/Divert task pattern
   ;deletechannelpattern      Deletes Channels/Divert task patterns
   ;listchannelpattern        Lists Channels/Divert task patterns
   ;emptychannelswindow       Empties the Channels task window
