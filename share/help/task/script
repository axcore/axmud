The Script task launches an Axbasic script, and continues to run for as long
   as the script runs.
Running an Axbasic script from within a task increases the range of Axbasic
   statements and functions available to it; in particular, it enables the
   script to open its own window, to create its own interfaces and to pause
   periodically.

Client commands used with Axbasic are:
   ;runscript                 Runs an Axbasic script
   ;runscripttask             Runs an Axbasic script as a task
   ;checkscript               Checks an Axbasic script
   ;editscript                Opens an Axbasic script for editing
   ;axbasichelp               Shows help for Axbasic scripts
