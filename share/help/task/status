The Status task monitors all text received from the world, looking for
   updates on your character's current status. It keeps track of statistics
   such as XP, hit points, lives left and so on. Much of the data collected
   is stored in the current world or character profile. If the task window is
   open, the data will be displayed in a format you can specify for yourself.
When the task window is open, certain events - such as when your character is
   running low on health points, is killed or falls asleep - will cause the
   window's colour to change. Some events will also cause one of Axmud's
   sound effects to be played (if sound has been turned on).
If you make the task 'active', every few seconds it will send a series of
   world commands ('score' is the most common command sent). Otherwise, the
   task's data will only be updated when you type world commands like 'score'
   yourself.
