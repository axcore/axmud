The Connections task displays a list of sessions. (A session handles a
   connection to a single world, even in 'connect offline' mode).
When the task is running, you can switch between sessions by pressing CTRL+1,
   CTRL+2, etc. CTRL+1 switches to the first session that was opened, and is
   still opened; CTRL+2 switches to the second, and so on.
Regardless of whether the task is running, you can also switch between sessions
   by pression CTRL+TAB (unless you've disabled that ability).
