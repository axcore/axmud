The Condition task is used in partnership with the Inventory task, which 
   keeps track of your character's inventory.
You can activate and disactivate the Condition task. While activated, the 
   task sends commands like 'examine sword' to the world periodically, hoping
   for a response like 'Your sword is in excellent condition'.
Ordinarily, one command is sent for every object in your character's
   inventory. The task waits for a response from each command before sending
   the next one.
However, if you defined one or more 'monitored objects', 'examine' commands 
   are only sent for items in the inventory which are marked as monitored.

   ;activateinventory         Activates the Inventory/Condition tasks
   ;disactivateinventory      Disactivates the Inventory/Condition tasks
