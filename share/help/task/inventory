The Inventory task is used to keep track of things in your character's
   inventory. The list of objects is usually displayed in the task's window.
You can activate and disactivate the task. While activated, the task sends
   the 'inventory' command for the current world (as specified by the
   command cages) periodically. The task then looks out for the world's
   response and updates its list accordingly. When the task is disactivated,
   the list is updated every time you type the world's 'inventory' command
   yourself.
The task is also used to apply certain actions to everything in your
   inventory except those you want to protect. The most common such action is
   to sell everything. The ';sellall' command will sell everything in the
   task's list of objects, one by one, except those which have been marked as
   protected.
The Inventory task is often used in partnership with the Condition task,
   which periodically sends world commands (like 'examine sword') to ask
   about the condition of items in the character's inventory, hoping for a
   response like 'Your sword is in excellent condition'.

   ;activateinventory         Activates the Inventory/Condition tasks
