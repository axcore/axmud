The Watch re-displays any text shown in all Channels, Chat and Divert tasks
   across every session. If you have multiple sessions open, you can open a
   Watch task so that you don't miss something important in other sessions.
The window usually changes colour for a few seconds to alert you that an
   update has been received.

Client commands used with this task are:
   ;emptywatchwindow          Empties the Watch task window
