DELALIAS expression

   Synopsis:
      Deletes an independent alias

   Notes:
      A convenient way to delete aliases created with the ADDALIAS statement.
         The expression is the name of the alias to delete.
      DELALIAS assumes that the alias is assigned to a cage belonging to the
         current world (unless an earlier PROFILE statement specified a
         different profile).
      The following Axbasic statements are therefore interchangeable:
      
         DELALIAS "name"
         CLIENT "deletealias name"
         
      If Axmud can't delete the alias, execution of the Axbasic script continues
         as normal. No error message is generated.

   Examples:
      DELALIAS "sailalias"
