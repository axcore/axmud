NEXTIFACE

   Synopsis:
      Deletes the current interface notification

   Notes:
      Whenever a trigger created by a SETTRIG statement fires, an 'interface
         notification' is created.
      The interface notification list contains all the notifications received
         but not yet processed. One of them - usually the first one in the
         list - is the 'current' notification.
         
      Axbasic functions like IFACENAME$() and IFACENUM() can be used to import
         information about the trigger that caused the current notification.
      Once you have all the information you need, use a NEXTIFACE statement to
         remove that notification from the list (permanently).
      If the modified list is not empty, the first notification in the list is
         marked as the new 'current' notification. If the list was already 
         empty, execution continues as normal and no error message is generated
         (so it is always safe to use a NEXTIFACE statement).

   Examples:
      SETTRIG "You are dead"

      WHILE 1
         IF IFACECOUNT() > 1
            ! Get the name and number of the current interface notification
            LET $name = IFACENAME$()
            LET number = IFACENUM()
            ! Delete the notification
            NEXTIFACE
         END IF

         ! Wait for the next Axmud task loop, before checking again
         BREAK
      LOOP
