CLIENT expression

   Synopsis:
      Executes a client command

   Notes:
      You don't need to use the client command sigil, so typing ';help' in the
         'main' window has the same effect as this Axbasic statement:
         
         CLIENT "help"

   Examples:
      CLIENT "starttask tasklist"
      CLIENT "startmission quest1"
      CLIENT "addtrigger -s <kills  you> -p <pray> -e 1 -n mytrig"
