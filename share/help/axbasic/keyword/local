LOCAL variable-name [ , variable-name ... ]

   Synopsis:
      Declares local variables

   Notes:
      Local variables are only available in the subroutine in which they are
         declared, whereas global variables (declared with a GLOBAL statement)
         are available to the whole Axbasic script.
      Var-Names must be a scalar variable. Array variables can be declared as
         local within a DIM LOCAL statement.

   Availability:
      LOCAL is not available in scripts with primitive line numbers.

   Examples:
      CALL MySub ()
      ! string$ and other$ are not available here
      END

      SUB STRING MySub ()
         LOCAL string$, other$
         LET string$ = "Hello world!"
         LET other$ = "Goodbye cruel world!"
         PRINT string$
         PRINT other$
      END SUB
