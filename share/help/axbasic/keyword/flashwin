FLASHWIN

   Synopsis:
      Sets the task window's urgency hint

   Notes:
      The effect of setting a window's urgency hint varies depending on the
         desktop environment you're using. Often, it causes the window to flash
         in the panel at the bottom (or top) of the screen.

   Requires:
      If the script is not being run as a task, or if not task window is open,
         the FLASHWIN statement is ignored (and no error message is generated).
         Execution continues with the next statement.
