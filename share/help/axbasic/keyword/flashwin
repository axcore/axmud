FLASHWIN

   Synopsis:
      Sets the task window's urgency hint

   Notes:
      If the Axbasic script isn't being run from within a task, the FLASHWIN
         statement is ignored (and no error message is generated). Execution
         continues immediately with the next statement.
      The effect of setting a window's urgency hint varies depending on the
         desktop environment you're using. Often, it causes the window to flash
         in the panel at the bottom (or top) of the screen.
