POKEEMPTY axmud-object-property

   Synopsis:
      Resets an Axmud internal scalar, list or hash property

   Notes:
      POKE gives Axbasic scripts access to some of Axmud's internal data (see 
         the help for the POKE statement for a full explanation). 
      POKEEMPTY can be used with scalar properties such as 
         "world.current.currencyHash", list properties such as 
         "world.current.doorPatternList" and hash properties such as
         "world.current.currencyHash". It cannot be used on Perl objects such as
         "world.current".
      POKEEMPTY resets the property. List properties are emptied so that they 
         contain no values. Hash properties are emptied so that they contain
         no key-value pairs. Scalar properties are set to the Perl special value
         'undef'. Using POKEEMPTY with a scalar value is the same as using a
         POKEUNDEF statement.
      Much of Axmud's internal data is read-only, and cannot be modified with
         POKE or with this statement. If you try to modify a read-only property
         you will get an 'operation failure' error.

   Warning: 
      Do not try to modify Axmud's internal data unless you know what you are 
         doing. Read the Axmud manual before you try to POKE anything. (The
         examples below are safe, but backup your data first.)

   Examples:
      ! Reset the world's long name
      POKEEMPTY "world.current.longName"
      ! Empty the world's list of dark room patterns
      POKEEMPTY "world.current.darkRoomPatternList"
      ! Empty the world's currency conversion chart
      POKEEMPTY "world.current.currencyHash"
