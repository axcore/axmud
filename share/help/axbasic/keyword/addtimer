ADDTIMER expression , expression [ , expression ]

   Synopsis:
      Adds an independent timer

   Notes:
      A convenient way to create timers. The first expression is the stimulus (a
         timer interval), the second is the response (an instruction). If the
         third expression is specified, it is used as the timer name; otherwise
         Axmud assigns a name to the timer.
      The following Axbasic statements are therefore interchangeable:
      
         ADDTIMER "stimulus", "response", "name"
         CLIENT "addtimer -s stimulus -p response -n name"
         
      If Axmud can't create the new timer, execution of the Axbasic script
         continues as normal. No error message is generated.
      All timers created by this statement are 'inactive' timers, and are 
         assigned to a cage belonging to the current world (unless an earlier 
         PROFILE statement specified a different profile). If there are no 
         higher-priority timers with the same name, the corresponding 'active' 
         timer will be created automatically.
      Timers created with this statement are automatically deleted when the
         script terminates (unless you use an OPTION PERSIST statement somewhere
         in the code).

   Examples:
      ADDTIMER 30, "inventory", "invtimer"
      ADDTIMER number, "buy beer"
