RELAY expression [ , expression ]

   Synopsis:
      Sends a non-movement command to the world

   Notes:
      Axmud attempts to work out which world commands are movement commands, and
         which are not. RELAY statements specify that the command is definitely 
         not a movement command.
      The first expression is the command to send.
      If you want to send a password to the world, but don't want it displayed 
         in the 'main' window (or saved in the command buffers), you can specify 
         the second expression, which should be a substring of the first. That 
         part of the command is obscured. To obscure the whole command, both 
         expressions should be identical.
      See also the help for MOVE and SEND.

   Examples:
      ! Send a non-movement command
      RELAY "open curtains"
      RELAY action$

      ! Send a password (and obscure the whole password)
      LET password$ = "123456"
      RELAY password$, password$

      ! Send a non-movement command, but obscure part of it
      LET command$ = "My PIN code is 1234"
      LET substring$ = "1234"
      RELAY command$, substring$
