LOGIN

   Synopsis:
      Marks the current character as logged in

   Notes:
      A LOGIN statement informs Axmud that the character has logged in to the
         world. It's useful in Axbasic scripts that are run to handle an 
         automatic login.
      If the current character is already marked as 'logged in', the LOGIN
         statement is ignored (and no error message is generated). Execution
         continues immediately with the next statement.

   Examples:
      ! Perform an automatic login
      LET name$ = "gandalf"
      LET password$ = "123456"
      ! Send an ordinary non-movement command
      RELAY name$
      ! Send an obscured password
      RELAY password$, password$
      PAUSE 1
      LOGIN
      END
