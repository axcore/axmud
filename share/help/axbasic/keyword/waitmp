WAITMP expression [ , expression ]

   Synopsis:
      Pauses execution until the character's magic points increase

   Notes:
      The first expression is a percentage, written as a number in the range 0
         to 100, where 100 is the maximum magic points (mP) the character can
         have, and 0 means no MP left at all. If you specify a value outside of
         this range (e.g. 1000), Axbasic will use a default value of 100.
      The second expression is a timeout measured in seconds. If specified, the
         script gives up waiting after that period and resumes execution.
      If the Axbasic script isn't being run from within a task, the WAITMP
         statement is ignored (and no error message is generated). Execution
         continues immediately with the next statement.
      WAITMP relies on the Status task to supply the character's current MP. If
         the Status task is not running (or if it doesn't know anything about
         the character's MP), the Axbasic script pauses briefly and resumes
         execution on the next task loop.

   Examples:
      ! Wait for MP to recover to at least 50% of maximum
      WAITMP 50
      ! Wait for no longer than five minutes (300 seconds)
      WAITMP 50, 300
