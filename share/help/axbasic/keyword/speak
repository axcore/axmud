SPEAK expression [ , expression ]

   Synopsis:
      Converts text to speech (TTS)

   Notes:
      Equivalent to the Axmud client command ';speak'. The first expression is
         the text to read aloud.
      The second expression, if specified, is the text-to-speech configuration
         to use. If no configuration is specified or if the specified
         configuration doesn't exist, the default configuration for Axbasic
         ('script') is used.

   Examples:
      SPEAK "Hello, world!"
      SPEAK "Hello, world!", "flite"
