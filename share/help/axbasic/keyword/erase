ERASE #channel

   Synopsis:
      Erases the contents of an open file

   Notes:
      Erases the contents of a file created with an earlier OPEN statement. 
      An error will be generated if the file channel is not open or if the 
         channel has been opened in read-only mode.

   Examples:
      ! Open a file for writing, appending new data to the end of the file
      OPEN #1: NAME "output.txt", CREATE NEWOLD, ACCESS OUTPUT
      PRINT #1: "This text is added to the end of the file"
      CLOSE #1
      END

      ! Open a file for writing, erasing its existing contents
      OPEN #1: NAME "output.txt", CREATE NEWOLD, ACCESS OUTPUT
      ERASE #1
      PRINT #1: "The file is emptied, then this text is added to it"
      CLOSE #1
      END
