RANDOMIZE

   Synopsis:
      Pseudo-statement for compatibility
      
   Notes:
      In older dialects of BASIC, a script produced the same sequence of random
         numbers whenever it was run, unless the script included a RANDOMIZE
         statement.
      For compatibility with older dialects, Axbasic provides a RANDOMIZE
         statement which does nothing, if executed.
