UNFLASHWIN

   Synopsis:
      Resets the task window's urgency hint

   Notes:
      The FLASHWIN statement sets the window's urgency hint and this statement
         resets it. The effect of setting a window's urgency hint varies 
         depending on the desktop environment you're using. Often, it causes the 
         window to flash in the panel at the bottom (or top) of the screen.

   Requires:
      If the script is not being run as a task, or if not task window is open,
         the UNFLASHWIN statement is ignored (and no error message is
         generated). Execution continues with the next statement.
