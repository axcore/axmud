UNFLASHWIN

   Synopsis:
      Resets the task window's urgency hint

   Notes:
      If the Axbasic script isn't being run from within a task, the UNFLASHWIN
         statement is ignored (and no error message is generated). Execution
         continues immediately with the next statement.
      The FLASHWIN statement sets the window's urgency hint and this statement
         resets it. The effect of setting a window's urgency hint varies 
         depending on the desktop environment you're using. Often, it causes the 
         window to flash in the panel at the bottom (or top) of the screen.
