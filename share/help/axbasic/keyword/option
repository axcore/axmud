   Synopsis:
      Sets various script-parsing options

   Notes:
      OPTION statements take effect before the Axbasic script is executed, so it
         makes no difference where in the script they are appear (although it is
         usually wise to put them at the top, before anything else.)

      OPTION ANGLE defines what kind of angles Axbasic trigonometric functions
         will expect as arguments. OPTION ANGLE DEGREES will cause functions
         like Sin (), Cos () and Tan () to expect an angle measured in degrees.
         OPTION ANGLE RADIANS will cause them to expect an angle measured in
         radians. If OPTION ANGLE isn't used at all, the functions will expect
         an angle measured in radians by default.
      OPTION NEEDTASK allows you to specify that the Axbasic script should not
         be allowed to run unless it is run within a task.
      OPTION NOLET allows you to omit the LET keyword in your Axbasic scripts:
         that is to say, instead of writing 'LET a$ = "hello"' all the time, you
         can use 'a$ = "hello"' instead. (LET statements can also be omitted in
         scripts with primitive line numbers, even when OPTION NOLET has not
         been used.)
      OPTION PERSIST makes all triggers, aliases, macros, timers and hooks
         created with the ADDTRIG, ADDALIAS, ADDMACRO, ADDTIMER and ADDHOOK
         statements persist beyond the end of the Axbasic script (normally, they
         are destroyed as soon as the script terminates.)
      OPTION PSEUDO changes the way the Axbasic script displays messages in the
         'main' window. The expression shouled be one of the strings used
         internally by the Axmud code:
            "show_all" - show all system messages
            "hide_complete" - show system error messages, but suppress system
               success messages (the default value)
            "hide_system" - suppress all system messages
            "win_error" - show system success messages, but display system error
               messages in 'dialogue' windows
            "win_only" - suppress system success messages, but show system error
               messages in 'dialogue' windows
      OPTION REDIRECT specifies that, if the task window is not open, the output
         of WRITEWIN statements should be redirected to the 'main' window
         (otherwise the output is not displayed at all).
      OPTION REQUIRE allows you to specify that the Axbasic script should not be
         allowed to run unless the version of Axbasic used by the client is at
         least the value of the expression.
      Using OPTION REQUIRE 1.0 would allow the Axbasic script to run with all
         versions of Axbasic, as would omitting OPTION REQUIRE altogether. Note
         that the Axbasic version number is not the same as the Axmud version
         number. To get the current Axbasic version number, use the VERSION()
         function in your Axbasic script or use the client command
         ';axbasichelp'.
      OPTION SILENT prevents Axbasic from displaying messages like
        'AXBASIC: Executing script' and 'AXBASIC: Execution of script complete',
        although error/debug messages are still displayed as normal
      OPTION TYPO requires all variables in the Axbasic script to be declared
         (with GLOBAL or LOCAL statements) before they can be used. Otherwise,
         undeclared variables are assumed to be global variables. OPTION TYPO
         is ignored in Axbasic script with line numbers, for which all variables
         are treated as global variables.

   Compatibility:
      Before Axbasic v1.002, OPTION REDIRECT was OPTION DIVERT
      OPTION SILENT is only available from Axbasic v1.003

   Examples:
      OPTION NOLET
      string$ = "Hello world"

      OPTION REQUIRE 1.2
