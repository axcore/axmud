POKEFALSE axmud-object-property

   Synopsis:
      Sets the value of an Axmud internal scalar property to FALSE

   Notes:
      POKE gives Axbasic scripts access to some of Axmud's internal data (see 
         the help for the POKE statement for a full explanation). 
      POKEFALSE is similar to POKE, but it only sets the value of scalar
         properties such as "world.current.longName". It cannot be used to set a
         list property such as "world.current.doorPatternList", a hash property
         such as "world.current.currencyHash" or a Perl object such as
         "world.current".
      POKEFALSE sets the scalar property to the Glib value FALSE, which is 
         actually an empty string. (TRUE is actually the string "1".)
      Much of Axmud's internal data is read-only, and cannot be modified with
         POKE or with this statement. If you try to modify a read-only property
         you will get an 'operation failure' error.

   Warning: 
      Do not try to modify Axmud's internal data unless you know what you are 
         doing. Read the Axmud manual before you try to POKE anything. (The
         examples below are safe, but backup your data first.)

   Examples:
      ! Tell the Locator task to stop collecting unknown words
      POKEFALSE "world.current.collectUnknownWordFlag"
