REDIM variable-name [ arg-list ] [ , variable-name [ arg-list ] ... ]

   Synopsis:
      Changes the size and dimensions of array variables

   Notes:
      REDIM replaces an existing array with a new array, using the same name.
      The only characteristic of the old array that is retained is its
         designation as global or local. Otherwise, DIM and REDIM statements
         behave in exactly the same way.

   Examples:
      ! An array containing 5 cells
      DIM stuff (5)
      ! Store a value in the first cell
      LET stuff (1) = 3.14
      ! Change it to a two-dimensional (10x10) array containing 100 cells
      REDDIM stuff (10, 10)
      ! Reset several arrays on one line
      REDIM firstarray (10), secondarray (20)
