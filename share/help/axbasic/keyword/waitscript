WAITSCRIPT expression

   Synopsis:
      Starts an Axbasic script and waits for it to terminate

   Notes:
      Starts a new Axbasic script (run from within a new Script task). The
         current script waits until the new script has terminated, before
         resuming execution.
      Arith-Exp is the name of the new script.

   Requires:
      If the script is not being run as a task, the WAITSCRPT statement is
         ignored (and no error message is generated). Execution continues with
         the next statement.

   Examples:
      WAITSCRIPT "otherscript"
      PRINT "I'm back, baby!"
