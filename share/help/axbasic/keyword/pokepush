POKEPUSH axmud-object-property, expression
POKEPUSH axmud-object-property

   Synopsis:
      Adds a value to the end of an Axmud internal list property

   Notes:
      POKE gives Axbasic scripts access to some of Axmud's internal data (see
         the help for the POKE statement for a full explanation).
      POKEPUSH is similar to POKE, but it only modifies list properties such as
         "world.current.doorPatternList". It cannot be used to modify a scalar
         property such as "world.current.longName", a hash property such as
         "world.current.currencyHash" or a Perl object such as "world.current".
      POKEPUSH adds the value of the expression to the end of the list. If you
         don't specify an expression, the Perl special value 'undef' is added
         to the end of the list.
      Much of Axmud's internal data is read-only, and cannot be modified with
         POKE or with this statement. If you try to modify a read-only property
         you will get an 'operation failure' error.

   Warning:
      Do not try to modify Axmud's internal data unless you know what you are
         doing. Read the Axmud manual before you try to POKE anything. (The
         examples below are safe, but backup your data first.)

   Examples:
      ! Add a new door pattern to the end of the existing list
      POKEPUSH "world.current.doorPatternList", "You bump into the door"
