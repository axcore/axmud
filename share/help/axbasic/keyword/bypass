BYPASS expression

   Synopsis:
      Executes a bypass command, bypassing any queued world commands
      
   Notes:
      This is the equivalent of a bypass command typed in the 'main' window's
         command entry box.
      The expression is executed as a world command immediately, bypassing any
         world commands which have been queued (because of the current world 
         profile's slowwalking settings or because crawl mode is on).
      If the bypass command produces any kind of error, the Axbasic script 
         continues as normal. No Axbasic error message is generated.
      See also the help for PERL, MULTI and SPEED.
   
   Examples:
      ! Execute a world command, bypassing any queued world commands
      BYPASS "drink water"
