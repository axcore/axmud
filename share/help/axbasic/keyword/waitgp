WAITGP expression [ , expression ]

   Synopsis:
      Pauses execution until the character's guild points increase

   Notes:
      The first expression is a percentage, written as a number in the range 0
         to 100, where 100 is the maximum guild points (GP) the character can
         have, and 0 means no GP left at all. If you specify a value outside of
         this range (e.g. 1000), Axbasic will use a default value of 100.
      The second expression is a timeout measured in seconds. If specified, the
         script gives up waiting after that period and resumes execution.
      See also the help for WAITEP, WAITHP, WAITMP, WAITSP, WAITTOTALXP and 
         WAITXP.

   Requires:
      If the script is not being run as a task, the WAITGP statement is ignored
         (and no error message is generated). Execution continues with the next
         statement.
         
   Examples:
      ! Wait for GP to recover to at least 50% of maximum
      WAITGP 50
      ! Wait for no longer than five minutes (300 seconds)
      WAITGP 50, 300
