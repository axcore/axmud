SEND expression [ , expression [ , expression ... ] ]

   Synopsis:
      Sends an interpolated world command
      
   Notes:
      Axmud has the ability to auto-interpolate commands so that a single 
         Axbasic script (as well as any tasks you write) can be designed to work 
         at more than one world.
      The first expression can be one of the standard commands specified by the
         command cages (such as "go", "throw_dir" or "wave_victim"). If so, it
         is interpolated using the remaining expressions (if any). If not, it is
         sent to the world, unaltered.
      See also the help for MOVE and RELAY.

   Examples:
      SEND "kill orc"
         In this case, the command is sent to the world unaltered.

      SEND "kill", "victim", "orc"
         "kill" is one of the standard commands specified by Axmud's command
         cages. By default, the cage expects a command in the format
         "kill victim". Here, the word-expression "victim" is replaced by the
         replacement-expression "orc".

         If the command cages for the current world have been modified to
         expect a command in a different format - perhaps something like "sneak
         up on victim" - the word "victim" is still interpolated, and the world
         receives the command 'sneak up on orc'.

      SEND "say_to", "victim", "orc", "text", "hello"
         "say_to" is another of the standard commands. By default, the cage
         expects a command in the format 'say text to victim'. The words "text"
         and "victim" are interpolated, so the world receives the command 'say
         hello to orc'.
