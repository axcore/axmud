SORTCASER variable-name

   Synopsis:
      Sorts the cells in an array variable in reverse order.

   Notes:
      String arrays are sorted reverse-alphabetically. The sort operation is
         case-insensitive, so 'zoo' will come before 'Aardvark'. (Use the SORTR
         statement if you want a case-sensitive sort opertion.)
      Numeric arrays are sorted in order of descending value. With numeric
         arrays, SORTR and SORTCASER produce the same output.
      Only one-dimensional arrays can be sorted. SORTR assumes that the array
         starts at element #1.
      Also see the help for SORTCASE.

   Examples:
      DATA 'ant', 'Bat', 'cat', 'Dog', 'eagle'
      DIM stuff (5)
      FOR a = 1 TO 5
         READ stuff (a)
      NEXT a

      SORTCASER stuff
      FOR a = 1 TO 5
         PRINT stuff (a)
      NEXT a
