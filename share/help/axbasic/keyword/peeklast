PEEKLAST variable-name = axmud-object-property
PEEKLAST ARRAY variable-name = axmud-object-property

   Synopsis:
      Fetches the last index of an Axmud internal list property

   Notes:
      PEEK gives Axbasic scripts access to most of Axmud's internal data (see
         the help for the PEEK statement for a full explanation).
      PEEKLAST can only be used with list properties such as
         "world.current.doorPatternList". It cannot be used with a scalar
         property such as "world.current.name", a hash property such as
         "world.current.currencyHash" or a Perl object such as "world.current".
      'variable-name' is set to the last index of the list property. Perl lists
         have 0 as their first index, so in a list of ten elements, the last
         index will be 9. If the list is empty, 'variable-name' is set to -1.
         If 'variable-name' is a string variable (or a string array), a string
         value such as "3" is used.

   Examples:
      ! Store the last index of a list property in an Axbasic global scalar
      ! variable
      PEEKLAST index = "world.current.doorPatternList"

      ! Store the last index of a list property in an Axbasic global array
      PEEKLAST ARRAY indices = "world.current.doorPatternList"

      ! Store the last index of a list property in an Axbasic local scalar
      !  variable
      LOCAL index
      PEEKLAST index = "world.current.doorPatternList"
