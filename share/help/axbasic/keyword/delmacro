DELMACRO expression

   Synopsis:
      Deletes an independent macro

   Notes:
      A convenient way to delete macros created with the ADDMACRO statement. The
         expression is the name of the macro to delete.
      DELMACRO assumes that the macro is assigned to a cage belonging to the
         current world (unless an earlier PROFILE statement specified a
         different profile).
      The following Axbasic statements are therefore interchangeable:
      
         DELMACRO "name"
         CLIENT "deletemacro name"
         
      If Axmud can't delete the macro, execution of the Axbasic script continues
         as normal. No error message is generated.
         
   Examples:
      DELMACRO "attackmacro"
