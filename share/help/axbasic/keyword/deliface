DELIFACE expression

   Synopsis:
      Deletes an active interface

   Notes:
      DELIFACE can be used to delete any active interface - if you know its 
         name. It should be only be used to delete the trigger interfaces
         created with a SETTRIG or WAITTRIG statement.
      To delete independent triggers (such as those created with an ADDTRIG
         statement), you should use a DELTRIG statement instead. The same 
         applies to independent aliases, macros, timers and hooks.

      The expression is the name of the active interface to delete.
      If Axmud can't delete the interface, execution of the Axbasic script
         continues as normal by executing the next statement (and no error
         message is generated).

   Examples:
      DELIFACE "status_task_trigger_11"
      DELIFACE Ifacename$ ()
