PEEKINDEX variable-name = axmud-object-property, expression
PEEKINDEX ARRAY variable-name = axmud-object-property, expression

   Synopsis:
      Stores the value of an Axmud internal list property whose index matches
         the expression

   Notes:
      PEEK gives Axbasic scripts access to most of Axmud's internal data (see 
         the help for the PEEK statement for a full explanation).
      PEEKINDEX can only be used with list properties such as 
         "world.current.doorPatternList". It cannot be used with a scalar 
         property such as "world.current.name", a hash property such as 
         "world.current.currencyHash" or a Perl object such as "world.current".
      'variable-name' is set to the value of the list property element whose 
         index matches the expression. Perl lists have 0 as their first index, 
         so in a list of ten elements, 'expression' must evaluate to an integer 
         between 0 and 9. If you use an index that is bigger than the list 
         itself - 15, for example - then a string variable will be set to an 
         empty string and a numeric variable will be set to 0. If the value of 
         the matching index is the Perl special value 'undef', a string variable 
         will be set to "<<undef>>" and a numeric variable will be set to 0.
      Normally you will use a PEEKNUMBER or PEEKLAST statement before a 
         PEEKINDEX statement, to check that index actually exists in the list.

   Examples:
      ! Get the size of the current world's door pattern list
      PEEKNUMBER size = "world.current.doorPatternList"
      ! Get the second pattern stored in the current world's door pattern list
      ! and store it in an Axbasic global scalar variable
      LET index = 2
      IF size > index THEN
         PEEKINDEX pattern$ = "world.current.doorPatternList", index
         PRINT pattern$
      END IF

      ! Store the second pattern in an Axbasic global array
      PEEKINDEX ARRAY patterns$ = "world.current.doorPatternList", 2
 
      ! Store the second pattern in an Axbasic local scalar variable
      LOCAL pattern$
      PEEKINDEX pattern$ = "world.current.doorPatternList", 2
