ADDMACRO expression , expression [ , expression ]

   Synopsis:
      Adds an independent macro

   Notes:
      A convenient way to create macros. The first expression is the stimulus
         (an Axmud keycode), the second is the response (an instruction). If the
         third expression is specified, it is used as the macro name; otherwise
         Axmud assigns a name to the macro.
      The following Axbasic statements are therefore interchangeable:

         ADDMACRO "stimulus", "response", "name"
         CLIENT "addmacro -s stimulus -p response -n name"

      If Axmud can't create the new macro, execution of the Axbasic script
         continues as normal. No error message is generated.
      All macros created by this statement are 'inactive' timers, and are
         assigned to a cage belonging to the current world (unless an earlier
         PROFILE statement specified a different profile). If there are no
         higher-priority macros with the same name, the corresponding 'active'
         macro will be created automatically.
      Macros created with this statement are automatically deleted when the
         script terminates (unless you use an OPTION PERSIST statement somewhere
         in the code).

   Examples:
      ADDMACRO "f5", "kill orc", "attackmacro"
      ADDMACRO "f10", "inventory"
