SETALIAS expression [ , expression ]

   Synopsis:
      Adds a dependent alias

   Notes:
      A convenient way to create an alias that launches another Axbasic script
         (or notifies this script's parent task) whenever it fires.
         
      The first expression is the stimulus (a pattern). For aliases, the
         pattern is matched against a world command.
      (Axmud automatically assigns its own name to dependent triggers.)
      
      If the second expression is specified, it should be the name of an Axbasic
         script to run immediately (without a parent task) when the alias fires.
      If the second expression is omitted, this script's parent task receives a
         notification when the alias fires. Axbasic provides several intrinsic
         (built-in) functions for getting information about these notifiacations
         (see the help for NEXTIFACE for more information).
      Also see the help for WAITALIAS.

   Requires:
      If the script is not being run as a task, a SETALIAS statement without a
         second expression (specifying another script to run) is ignored (and no
         error message is generated). Execution continues with the next
         statement.
         
   Compatibility:
      Since Axbasic v1.4
      
   Examples:
      SETALIAS "^kill orc$"
      SETALIAS "^kill orc$", "check_equipment"
