DELTRIG expression

   Synopsis:
      Deletes an independent trigger

   Notes:
      A convenient way to delete triggers created with the ADDTRIG statement.
         The expression is the name of the trigger to delete.
      DELTRIG assumes that the trigger is assigned to a cage belonging to the
         current world (unless an earlier PROFILE statement specified a
         different profile).
      The following Axbasic statements are therefore interchangeable:

         DELTRIG "name"
         CLIENT "deletetrigger name"

      If Axmud can't delete the trigger, execution of the Axbasic script
         continues as normal. No error message is generated.

   Examples:
      DELTRIG "deadtrig"
