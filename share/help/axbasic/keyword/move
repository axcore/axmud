MOVE expression

   Synopsis:
      Sends a movement command to the world

   Notes:
      Axmud attempts to work out which world commands are movement commands, and
         which are not.
      MOVE statements specify that the command is definitely a movement command,
         so the Locator task is told to expect a new room description regardless
         of the contents of the expression.
      See also the help for RELAY and SEND.

   Examples:
      MOVE "north"
      MOVE direction$
      MOVE "squeeze between curtains"
