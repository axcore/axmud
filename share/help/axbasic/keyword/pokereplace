POKEREPLACE axmud-object-property, expression

   Synopsis:
      Replaces a value in an Axmud internal list property

   Notes:
      POKE gives Axbasic scripts access to some of Axmud's internal data (see 
         the help for the POKE statement for a full explanation). 
      POKEREPLACE is similar to POKE, but it only modifies list properties such
         as "world.current.doorPatternList". It cannot be used to modify a 
         scalar property such as "world.current.longName", a hash property such
         as "world.current.currencyHash" or a Perl object such as 
         "world.current".
      POKEREPLACE replaces a single value in the list property at the index
         matching the value of the first expression. Perl list indices begin at
         0, so using an index of 9 modifies the tenth value in the list. The 
         value of the second expression replaces the old value. If you don't
         specify a second expression, the Perl special value 'undef' replaces 
         the old value.
      Much of Axmud's internal data is read-only, and cannot be modified with
         POKE or with this statement. If you try to modify a read-only property
         you will get an 'operation failure' error.

   Warning: 
      Do not try to modify Axmud's internal data unless you know what you are 
         doing. Read the Axmud manual before you try to POKE anything. (The
         examples below are safe, but backup your data first.)

   Examples:
      ! Replace the third pattern the current world's dark room pattern list
      POKEREPLACE "world.current.darkRoomPatternList", 2, "You cannot see"
