PEEKEQUALS variable-name = axmud-object-property, expression
PEEKEQUALS ARRAY variable-name = axmud-object-property, expression

   Synopsis:
      Returns the index of an Axmud internal list property whose numeric value
         is equal to the numeric expression

   Notes:
      PEEK gives Axbasic scripts access to most of Axmud's internal data (see
         the help for the PEEK statement for a full explanation).
      PEEKEQUALS can only be used with list properties such as
         "world.current.doorPatternList". It cannot be used with a scalar
         property such as "world.current.name", a hash property like
         "world.current.currencyHash" or a Perl object like "world.current".
      'variable-name' is set to the index of the first element in the list
         property whose value is the same as the value of the expression. If the
         value of the expression is not numeric, you will get an error.
         Otherwise, the value of the expression is compared against the values
         of the list, as if those values were numbers. If none of the list's
         values equal the value of the expression, or if the list is empty, the
         variable is set to -1.
      PEEKFIND cannot be used to search a list property for the Perl special
         value, 'undef'.

   Examples:
      ! Store the index of the first matching value in an Axbasic global scalar
      ! variable
      PEEKEQUALS index = "imaginary.list.property", 5

      ! Store the index of the matching value in an Axbasic global array
      PEEKEQUALS ARRAY indices = "imaginary.list.property", 5

      ! Store the index of the matching value in an Axbasic local scalar
      ! variable
      LOCAL index
      PEEKEQUALS index = "imaginary.list.property", 5
