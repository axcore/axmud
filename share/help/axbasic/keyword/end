END
END IF
END SUB
END SELECT

   Synopsis:
      END terminates the Axbasic script
      END IF terminates the current IF code block
      END SUB terminates the current subroutine
      END SELECT terminates the current SELECT CASE code block

   Notes:
      All Axbasic scripts must have one, and only one, END statement (but you 
         can use as many STOP statements as you like).
      See the help for IF, SUB and SELECT for a full explanation of how to use
         END IF, END SUB and END SELECT statements.

   Examples:
      ! The simplest possible Axbasic script
      PRINT "Hello world!"
      END
