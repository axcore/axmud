WINADDSTATUS expression , expression

   Synopsis:
      Adds a task window status bar

   Notes:
      Adds a status bar to the task window, in the same area that gauges are
         displayed.
      Unlike graphical gauges, status bars display two numbers as simple text.
         For example, your character's health points and maximum health points
         might be displayed as "HP: 33/100". The first value is expected (but
         not required) to be less than or equal to the second.

      The first expression is a unique status bar number. You can specify any
         integer, zero or above. If a status bar with this number already
         exists, it is replaced with a new one. It's up to the script to keep
         track of the unique numbers of any status bars it has created. (Status
         bar numbers are independent of the numbers used with ADDSTATUS,
         ADDGAUGE, WINADDGAUGE and so on.)
      The second expression is the label displayed with the numbers, for example
         "HP". If it's an empty string, Axbasic will assign its own label.

      A WINADDSTATUS statement is usually followed by a WINSETSTATUS statement,
         which sets the numeric values displayed by the status bar. A
         WINDELSTATUS statement removes the status bar entirely. Status bars are
         automatically removed when the script terminates (or when the task
         window closes).
      Often, these statements are used in some kind of loop, which updates the
         status bars periodically. See the code below for an example.

      See also the help for the WINADDCONSTATUS, WINADDGAUGE and WINADDCONGAUGE
         statements. To display status bars in the 'main' window, see the help
         for the ADDSTATUS statement.

   Requires:
      If the script is not being run as a task, or if the task window is not
         open, the WINADDSTATUS statement is ignored (and no error message is
         generated). Execution continues with the next statement.

   Examples:
      OPTION NEEDTASK
      OPTION NOLET

      OPENWIN
      WINADDSTATUS 1, "TEST"

      FOR a = 0 to 10
         WINSETSTATUS 1, a, 10
         PAUSE 1
      NEXT a

      WINDELSTATUS 1
      CLOSEWIN

      END
