PEEKGET variable-name = axmud-object-property
PEEKGET ARRAY variable-name = axmud-object-property

   Synopsis:
      Imports data from an Axmud internal scalar property

   Notes:
      PEEK gives Axbasic scripts access to most of Axmud's internal data (see
         the help for the PEEK statement for a full explanation).
      PEEKGET behaves in the same way as PEEK, but it only imports data from
         scalar properties such as "world.current.name". It cannot be used to
         import a list property such as "world.current.doorPatternList", a hash
         property such as "world.current.currencyHash" or a Perl object such as
         "world.current".

   Examples:
      ! Import a scalar property into an Axbasic global scalar variable
      PEEKGET name$ = "world.current.name"

      ! Import a scalar property into an Axbasic global array
      PEEKGET ARRAY worlds$ = "world.current.name"

      ! Import a scalar property into an Axbasic local scalar variable
      LOCAL name$
      PEEKGET name$ = "world.current.name"
