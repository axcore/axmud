RESTORE

   Synopsis:
      Resets the global data list, as if no READ statements had been executed

   Notes:
      After a RESTORE statement, the next READ statement will start reading from
         the first constant in the first DATA statement in the Axbasic script.

   Examples:
      DATA 5, 10, 20, 50, 100
      READ num1, num2, num3
      PRINT num1, num2, num3

      RESTORE
      READ num4
      ! The next line displays the number 5
      PRINT num4
