   Synopsis:
      Adds a task window gauge

   Notes:
      Adds a gauge to the task window. This gauge displays two numeric values,
         such as your character's current XP and the amount of XP required to
         reach the next level.
      It's expected (but not required) that the sum of these two values is
         constant, at least in the short term. In other words, when one value
         falls by some amount, the other value is expected to rise by the same
         ammount. (The "CON" in WINADDCONGAUGE stands for "constant".)

      The first expression is a unique gauge number. You can specify any
         integer, zero or above. If a gauge with this number already exists, it
         is replaced with a new one. It's up to the script to keep track of the
         unique numbers of any gauges it has created. (Gauge numbers are
         independent of the numbers used with ADDGAUGE, ADDSTATUS, WINADDSTATUS
         and so on.)
      The second expression is the label drawn above the gauge, for example
         "HP". If it's an empty string, Axbasic will assign its own label.
      The remaining optional expressions specify which colours to use. If
         they're not specified, default colours are used. The first one is the
         colour of the full portion of the gauge; the second is the colour of
         the empty portion of the gauge; the third is the colour of the label.
      Colours must be valid Axmud colour tags (standard tags such as "RED" or
         "blue", xterm tags such as "x0" or "x255", or RGB tags such as
         "#000000" or "#FFFFFF"). Any invalid colour tags are ignored and
         default colours are used instead.

      A WINADDCONGAUGE statement is usually followed by a WINSETGAUGE statement,
         which sets the numeric values displayed by the gauge. A WINDELGAUGE
         statement removes the gauge entirely. Gauges are automatically removed
         when the script terminates (or when the task window closes).
      Often, these statements are used in some kind of loop, which updates the
         gauges periodically. See the code below for an example.

      See also the help for the ADDGAUGE, ADDSTATUS and ADDCONSTATUS statements.
         To display gauges in the 'main' window, see the help for
         the ADDCONGAUGE statement.

   Requires:
      If the script is not being run as a task, or if the task window is not
         open, the WINADDCONGAUGE statement is ignored (and no error message is
         generated). Execution continues with the next statement.

   Examples:
      OPTION NEEDTASK
      OPTION NOLET

      OPENWIN
      WINADDCONGAUGE 1, "TEST", "RED", "red", "WHITE"

      FOR a = 0 to 10
         WINSETGAUGE 1, a, (10 - a)
         PAUSE 1
      NEXT a

      WINDELGAUGE 1
      CLOSEWIN

      END
