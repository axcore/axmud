WINDELSTATUS expression

   Synopsis:
      Deletes a task window status bar

   Notes:
      Deletes a status bar that was added to the task window with a WINADDSTATUS
         or WINADDCONSTATUS statement.
      The expression is the status bar's unique number. If the status bar
         doesn't exist, the WINDELSTATUS statement is ignored, but the number
         isn't an integer, 0 or above, you'll see an error message.

   Requires:
      If the script is not being run as a task, the WINDELSTATUS statement is
         ignored (and no error message is generated). Execution continues with
         the next statement.

   Examples:
      WINDELSTATUS 1
