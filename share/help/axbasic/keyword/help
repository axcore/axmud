HELP
HELP expression

   Synopsis:
      Displays Axbasic help in the 'main' window

   Notes:
      If an expression is specified, help for that topic is displayed. Help is
         available for all Axbasic keywords and intrinsic (built-in) functions.
      If no expression is specified, a list of Axbasic keywords and functions is
         displayed instead.
      The following Axbasic statements are therefore interchangeable:
      
         HELP "print"
         CLIENT "axbasichelp print"

   Examples:
      HELP "print"
      HELP "chr$"
      HELP date
      HELP

      LET keyword$ = "print"
      HELP keyword$
