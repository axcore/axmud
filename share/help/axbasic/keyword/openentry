OPENENTRY

   Synopsis:
      Opens a task window with an entry (input) box

   Notes:
      If the script is being run from within a task, this statement asks the
         task to open a task window.
      Use the WRITEWIN statement to display text in the task window.
      Use the OPENWIN statement to open a task without an entry (input) box. The
         CLOSEWIN statement closes the task window regardless of whether it has
         an entry box, or not.

   Requires:
      If the script is not being run as a task, or if the task window is already
         open, the OPENENTRY statement is ignored (and no error message is
         generated). Execution continues with the next statement.

   Examples:
      OPENENTRY
      WRITEWIN "Hello world!"
      INPUT "Enter a number"; num
      WRITEWIN "Goodbye!"
      PAUSE 5
      CLOSEWIN
