OPENENTRY

   Synopsis:
      Opens a task window with an entry (input) box

   Notes:
      If the script is being run from within a task, this statement asks the
         task to open a task window.
      If the Axbasic script isn't being run from within a task, or if the task
         window is already open, the OPENENTRY statement is ignored (and no
         error message is generated). Execution continues immediately with the
         next statement.
      Use the WRITEWIN statement to display text in the task window.
      Use the OPENWIN statement to open a task without an entry (input) box. The
         CLOSEWIN statement closes the task window regardless of whether it has
         an entry box, or not.

   Examples:
      OPENENTRY
      WRITEWIN "Hello world!"
      INPUT "Enter a number"; num
      WRITEWIN "Goodbye!"
      PAUSE 5
      CLOSEWIN
