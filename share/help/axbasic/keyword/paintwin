PAINTWIN [ expression ]

   Synopsis:
      Changes the task window's colour scheme

   Notes:
      Some task windows (such as the one used by the Locator task) use a variety
         of colours on a black background. Other task windows (such as the one
         used by the Status task) use several different background colours, with
         the text colour automatically set to match.
      The Script task window behaves like the Locator task window, by default.
         However, this statement changes the window's background colour so that
         it behaves more like the Status task window.
      If specified, the expression must be one of Axmud's standard text colour
         tags, namely "black", "red", "green", "yellow", "blue", "magenta",
         "cyan", "white". Any of these colours can be specified IN CAPITALS to
         make them bolder (e.g. "RED", "GREEN").
      The text colours is automatically changed to match the background colour.
         Any colours specified by earlier WRITEWIN statements are lost.
      If no colour is specified, the default colour scheme is used.

      Axmud underlay colours such as "ul_red" and "UL_BLUE" can also be
         specified; the corresponding normal colour is used.

   Requires:
      If the script is not being run as a task, or if not task window is open,
         the PAINTWIN statement is ignored (and no error message is generated).
         Execution continues with the next statement.

   Examples:
      PAINTWIN "white"
      PAINTWIN "CYAN"
      PAINTWIN
