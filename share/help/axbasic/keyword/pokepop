POKEPOP variable-name = axmud-object-property
POKEPOP ARRAY variable-name = axmud-object-property

   Synopsis:
      Removes a value from the end of an Axmud internal list property

   Notes:
      PEEK gives Axbasic scripts access to most of Axmud's internal data (see 
         the help for the PEEK statement for a full explanation).
      POKEPOP can only be used with list properties such as 
         "world.current.doorPatternList". It cannot be used with a scalar 
         property such as "world.current.name", a hash property such as 
         "world.current.currencyHash" or a Perl object such as "world.current".
      'variable-name' is set to the last value of the list property. In 
         addition, that value is removed from the list property. If the list
         property is empty, a string variable is set to  "<<undef>>" and a
         numeric variable is set to 0.
      Much of Axmud's internal data is read-only, and cannot be modified with
         this statement. If you try to modify a read-only property you will get 
         an 'operation failure' error.

   Warning: 
      Do not try to modify Axmud's internal data unless you know what you are 
         doing. Read the Axmud manual before you try to POKEPOP anything. (The
         examples below are safe, but backup your data first.)

   Compatibility:
      Before Axbasic v1.002, POKEPOP was PEEKPOP.
      
   Examples:
      ! Remove the last value from a list property and store it in an Axbasic
      ! global scalar variable
      POKEPOP pattern$ = "world.current.doorPatternList"

      ! Remove the last value from a list property and store it in an Axbasic 
      ! global array
      POKEPOP ARRAY patterns$ = "world.current.doorPatternList"
 
      ! Remove the last value from a list property and store it in an Axbasic 
      ! local scalar variable
      LOCAL pattern$
      POKEPOP pattern$ = "world.current.doorPatternList"
