CLOSEWIN

   Synopsis:
      Closes the task window

   Notes:
      If the script is being run from within a task, this statement asks the
         task to close the task window.
      If the Axbasic script isn't being run from within a task, or if no task
         window is open, the CLOSEWIN statement is ignored (and no error message
         is generated). Execution continues immediately with the next statement.

   Examples:
      OPENWIN
      WRITEWIN "Hello world!"
      PAUSE 5
      CLOSEWIN
