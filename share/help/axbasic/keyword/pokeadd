POKEADD axmud-object-property, expression, expression
POKEADD axmud-object-property, expression

   Synopsis:
      Adds a key-value pair to an Axmud internal hash property

   Notes:
      POKE gives Axbasic scripts access to some of Axmud's internal data (see 
         the help for the POKE statement for a full explanation). 
      POKEADD is similar to POKE, but it only modifies hash properties such as
         "world.current.currencyHash". It cannot be used to modify a scalar 
         property such as "world.current.longName", a list property such as
         "world.current.doorPatternList" or a Perl object such as 
         "world.current".
      POKEADD adds a key-value pair to the hash property. The first 'expression'
         is the key, the second 'expression' is the key's corresponding value. 
         If you omit the second expression, the value used is the Perl special 
         value 'undef'. If the key already exists in the hash, the old key-value
         pair is replaced.
      Much of Axmud's internal data is read-only, and cannot be modified with
         POKE or with this statement. If you try to modify a read-only property
         you will get an 'operation failure' error.

   Warning: 
      Do not try to modify Axmud's internal data unless you know what you are 
         doing. Read the Axmud manual before you try to POKE anything. (The
         examples below are safe, but backup your data first.)

   Examples:
      ! Add a new unit of currency. On DeadSouls, this would make each diamond
      ! coin be worth 10 platinum coins
      POKEADD "world.current.currencyHash", "diamond", 10
