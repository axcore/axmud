PEEKPAIRS variable-name = axmud-object-property
PEEKPAIRS ARRAY variable-name = axmud-object-property

   Synopsis:
      Fetches the number of key-value pairs in an Axmud internal hash property

   Notes:
      PEEK gives Axbasic scripts access to most of Axmud's internal data (see 
         the help for the PEEK statement for a full explanation).
      PEEKPAIRS can only be used with hash properties such as 
         "world.current.currencyHash". It cannot be used with a scalar property 
         such as "world.current.name", a list property such as 
         "world.current.doorPatternList" or a Perl object such as 
         "world.current".
      'variable-name' is set to the number of key-value pairs in the hash
         property. If the hash is empty, the size is 0. If 'variable-name' is a 
         string variable (or a string array), a string value such as "3" is 
         used.         
                  
   Examples:
      ! Store the number of key-value pairs from a hash property in an Axbasic 
      ! scalar variable
      PEEKPAIRS size = "world.current.currencyHash"

      ! Store the number of key-value pairs from a hash property in an Axbasic 
      ! global array
      PEEKNUMBER ARRAY sizes = "world.current.currencyHash"
 
      ! Store the number of key-value pairs from a hash property in an Axbasic 
      ! local scalar variable 
      DIM LOCAL size
      PEEKPAIRS size = "world.current.currencyHash"
