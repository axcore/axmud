CALL subroutine-name
CALL subroutine-name ( [ expression [ , expression ... ] ] )

   Synopsis:
      Calls a subroutine with the specified arguments

   Notes:
      The arguments, if any, must match those in the SUB statement's parameter
         list, both in type and number.

      All Axbasic subroutines have a return value, the default value being 0. In
         the following statement, the return value is discarded:
         
         CALL MySub

      If you want to test the return value, you can use a LET statement to
         capture it:         
      
         LET result = CALL MySub (...)
         
      Note that CALL is a statement, not a function, so it cannot be used thus:
      
         PRINT 10 * (CALL MySub (...))

   Availability:
      CALL is not available in scripts with primitive line numbers.

   Examples:
      LET number1 = 2
      LET number2 = 5
      LET result = CALL Multiply (number1, number2)
      PRINT result
      END

      SUB NUMERIC Multiply (val1, val2)
         RETURN (val1 * val2)
      END SUB
