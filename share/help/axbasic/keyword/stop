STOP

   Synopsis:
      Stops the Axbasic script

   Notes:
      Also see the help for END.
      All Axbasic script must have one, and only one, END statement (but you can
         use as many STOP statements as you like).

   Examples:
      CALL MySub()
      PRINT "This line is never executed"
      END

      SUB STRING MySub ()
         PRINT "Goodbye cruel world!"
         STOP
      END SUB
