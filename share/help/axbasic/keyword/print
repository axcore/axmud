PRINT [ expression [ separator ] [ expression [ separator ] ... ] ]
PRINT #channel: expression [ separator ] [ expression [ separator ] ... ]

   Synopsis:
      Displays one or more expressions or writes data to a file

   Notes:
      The first form of the PRINT statement displays data in the 'main' window.
      If the script was started with an Axmud command like this:

         ;runscript myscript -w

      ...the script is running in 'forced window' mode. A task window is opened
         even though the script doesn't ask for one, and the output from all
         PRINT, INPUT and WRITEWIN statements is displayed in the window. This
         is useful for running old BASIC scripts in their own window, even
         though the scripts don't know anything about Axmud task windows.
      In place of an expression, you can use the pseudo-function TAB (). The
         pseudo-function takes one argument: a column number (the first column
         is 1). Axbasic moves its "cursor" to that column or, if the "cursor"
         has already advanced beyond that column, to the same position on the
         next line. For the benefit of ancient BASIC programmes, a floating-
         point number is rounded down, and column 1 is used for any value less
         than 1.

      The second form of the PRINT statement writes data to a file channel
         created with an earlier OPEN statement. If the file channel is closed
         or if it was opened in read-only mode, an error is generated.

      The Axbasic PRINT separators are ';' and ','. If no PRINT separators are
         present, each expression is printed on a new line. If there is no
         semicolon after the last expression, a newline character is printed
         after the last expression.
      Numerical expressions are PRINTed with a leading space (or a minus sign),
         and a trailing space.
      Commas behave like a 14-character tab (but like a newline character past
         column 56).
      See also the help for DEBUG, ERROR, WARNING and WRITE.

   Examples:
      ! Display the same line of text three times
      PRINT "Hello world!"
      PRINT "Hello" ; " " ; "world!"
      PRINT "Hello";
      PRINT " world!"
      END

      ! Print data in equally-spaced columns
      LET val1 = 10
      LET val2 = 20
      LET val3 = 50
      PRINT "Column 1" , "Column 2" , "Column 3"
      PRINT val1 , val2 , val3
      END

      ! Print data in unusually-spaced columns
      LET val1 = 10
      LET val2 = 20
      LET val3 = 50
      PRINT "Column 1" ; TAB(15) ; "Column 2" ; TAB (40) ; "Column 3"
      PRINT val1 ; TAB(15) ; val2 ; TAB (40) ; val3
      END

      ! Write data to a file
      OPEN #1: NAME "myfile.txt", CREATE NEWOLD
      PRINT #1: "Going ";
      PRINT #1: "going ";
      PRINT #1: "gone!"
      CLOSE #1
      END
