SELECT CASE variable-name

   Synopsis:
      Initiates a SELECT CASE code block

   Notes:
      A compact way of writing code that would otherwise have to be written as a
         series of IF, ELSE IF and ELSE statements.
      Only constants (and not variables) can be used in the subsequent CASE
         statements.
      After SELECT CASE, execution passes to the statement after the END SELECT
         statement. Therefore a statement after SELECT CASE, on the same line,
         will never be executed. (A statement after END SELECT, on the same
         line, will be executed as normal.)

   Availability:
      SELECT is not available in scripts with primitive line numbers.

   Examples:
      SELECT CASE dice
         CASE 1
            PRINT "The lowest number!"
         CASE 3, 4
            PRINT "Somewhere in the middle!"
         CASE 6
            PRINT "The highest number!"
         CASE ELSE
            PRINT "Some other number!"
            IF dice = 5 THEN PRINT "It's a five!" ELSE PRINT "It's a two!"
      END SELECT
