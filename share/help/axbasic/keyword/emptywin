EMPTYWIN

   Synopsis:
      Empties the task window

   Notes:
      EMPTYWIN has exactly the same functionality as CLS.
      If you want to empty text in the 'main' window, you can use the client
         command ';cls'.

   Requires:
      If the script is not being run as a task, or if not task window is open,
         the EMPTYWIN statement is ignored (and no error message is generated).
         Execution continues with the next statement.

   Examples:
      ! Empty the task window
      EMPTYWIN

      ! Empty the 'main' window
      CLIENT "cls"
