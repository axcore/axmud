EMPTYWIN

   Synopsis:
      Empties the task window

   Notes:
      If the Axbasic script isn't being run from within a task, the EMPTYWIN
         statement is ignored (and no error message is generated). Execution
         continues immediately with the next statement.
      EMPTYWIN has exactly the same functionality as CLS.
      If you want to empty text in the 'main' window, you can use the client 
         command ';cls'.

   Examples:
      ! Empty the task window
      EMPTYWIN

      ! Empty the 'main' window
      CLIENT "cls"
