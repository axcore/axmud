PEEKMATCH variable-name = axmud-object-property, expression
PEEKMATCH ARRAY variable-name = axmud-object-property, expression

   Synopsis:
      Stores the index of an Axmud internal list property whose value matches
         the regex expression

   Notes:
      PEEK gives Axbasic scripts access to most of Axmud's internal data (see 
         the help for the PEEK statement for a full explanation).
      PEEKMATCH can only be used with list properties such as 
         "world.current.doorPatternList". It cannot be used with a scalar 
         property such as "world.current.name", a hash property such as 
         "world.current.currencyHash" or a Perl object such as "world.current".
      'expression' is a Perl regex (regular expression). 'variable-name' is set 
         to the index of the first element in the list property whose value 
         matches the regex. If none of the list's values match the regex, or if
         the list is empty, the variable is set to -1. 
      PEEKMATCH cannot be used to search a list property for the Perl special
         value, 'undef'.

   Examples:
      ! Store the index of the first matching value in an Axbasic global scalar
      ! variable
      PEEKMATCH index = "world.current.doorPatternList", "^You bump into"

      ! Store the index of the matching value in an Axbasic global array
      PEEKMATCH ARRAY data = "world.current.doorPatternList", "^You bump into"
 
      ! Store the index of the matching value in an Axbasic local scalar 
      ! variable
      LOCAL index
      PEEKFIND index = "world.current.doorPatternList", "^You bump into"
