MULTI expression

   Synopsis:
      Executes a world command in multiple sessions

   Notes:
      This is the equivalent of a multi command typed in the 'main' window's
         command entry box.
      The expression is executed as a world command in muliple sessions; either
         in all sessions connected to the same world as this session, or in
         every single session (use ';toggleinstruction -m' to switch between
         these two settings).
      If the multi command produces any kind of error, the Axbasic script
         continues as normal. No Axbasic error message is generated.
      See also the help for PERL, SPEED and BYPASS.

   Examples:
      ! Execute the same world command in multiple session
      MULTI "kill orc"
