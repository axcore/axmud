WAITSLEEP [ expression ]

   Synopsis:
      Pauses execution until the character's life status is 'sleep'

   Notes:
      The Status task recognises four states of being for the character: 
         "alive", "sleep", "passout" and "dead". Whenever the character is not
         asleep, passed out or dead, they're considered alive.
      The expression is a timeout measured in seconds. If specified, the script
         gives up waiting after that period and resumes execution.
         
      WAITSLEEP relies on the Status task to supply the character's current life
         status. If the Status task is not running, the Axbasic script pauses 
         briefly and resumes execution on the next task loop.
      If the Status task doesn't know about the character's status, it assumes
         that the character is alive.
      See also the help for WAITALIVE, WAITDEAD and WAITPASSOUT.

   Requires:
      If the script is not being run as a task, the WAITSLEEP statement is
         ignored (and no error message is generated). Execution continues with
         the next statement.
         
   Examples:
      WAITSLEEP
      WAITSLEEP 100
