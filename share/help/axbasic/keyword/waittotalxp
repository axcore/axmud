WAITTOTALXP expression [ , expression ]

   Synopsis:
      Pauses execution until the character's total experience points (XP) 
         increase

   Notes:
      The first expression is a number matching the 'total' experience points
         the character has, which is usually different from their 'current' XP
         (depending on the world).
      The second expression is a timeout measured in seconds. If specified, the
         script gives up waiting after that period and resumes execution.
      If the Axbasic script isn't being run from within a task, the WAITTOTALXP
         statement is ignored (and no error message is generated). Execution
         continues immediately with the next statement.
      WAITTOTALXP relies on the Status task to supply the character's total XP. 
         If the Status task is not running (or if it doesn't know anything about
         the character's total XP), the Axbasic script pauses briefly and 
         resumes execution on the next task loop.

         WAITXP and WAITNEXTXP.

   Examples:
      ! Wait for total XP to reach 50000
      WAITTOTALXP 50000
      ! Wait for no longer than five minutes (300 seconds)
      WAITTOTALXP 50000, 300
