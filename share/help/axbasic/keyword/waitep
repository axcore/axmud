WAITEP expression [ , expression ]

   Synopsis:
      Pauses execution until the character's energy points increase

   Notes:
      The first expression is a percentage, written as a number in the range 0
         to 100, where 100 is the maximum energy points (EP) the character can
         have, and 0 means no EP left at all. If you specify a value outside of
         this range (e.g. 1000), Axbasic will use a default value of 100.
      The second expression is a timeout measured in seconds. If specified, the
         script gives up waiting after that period and resumes execution.
      WAITEP relies on the Status task to supply the character's current EP. If
         the Status task is not running (or if it doesn't know anything about
         the character's EP), the Axbasic script pauses briefly and resumes
         execution on the next task loop.
      See also the help for WAITHP, WAITMP, WAITSP, WAITTOTALXP and WAITXP.

   Requires:
      If the script is not being run as a task, the WAITEP statement is ignored
         (and no error message is generated). Execution continues with the next
         statement.
         
   Examples:
      ! Wait for EP to recover to at least 50% of maximum
      WAITEP 50
      ! Wait for no longer than five minutes (300 seconds)
      WAITEP 50, 300
