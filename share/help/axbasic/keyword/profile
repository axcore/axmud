PROFILE [ expression ]

   Synopsis:
      Specifies the Axmud profile used in ADDTRIG and DELTRIG (etc) statements

   Notes:
      Both the ADDTRIG and DELTRIG statements assume that the trigger to be 
         added or deleted is associated with the current world profile.
      If you specify a different profile using a PROFILE statement, then ADDTRIG 
         and DELTRIG will use that profile instead.
      PROFILE also specifies the profile used by ADDALIAS, ADDHOOK, ADDMACRO, 
         ADDTIMER, DELALIAS, DELHOOK, DELMACRO and DELTIMER statements.
      The expression is the name of the profile. If no profile is specified or 
         if the specified profile doesn't exist, Axbasic resumes using the 
         current world.

   Examples:
      ! Add triggers to the 'orc' race profile
      PROFILE "orc"
      ADDTRIG "The knight kills you", ";runscript orc_prayers"
      ADDTRIG "The knight strikes you", ";runscript orc_escape"

      ! Add triggers to the current world profile
      PROFILE
      ADDTRIG "The knight kills you", "pray"
      ADDTRIG "The knight strikes you", "escape"
