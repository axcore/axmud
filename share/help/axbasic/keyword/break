BREAK

   Synopsis:
      Pauses execution of the Axbasic script briefly

   Notes:
      When the Axbasic script is being run from within an Axmud task, execution 
         can be suspended with statements such as PAUSE, SLEEP, BREAK and 
         WAITTRIG.
      BREAK causes execution of the script to halt until the next task loop (by
         default, the task loop spins ten times a second).
      If the Axbasic script isn't being run from within an Axmud task, there is 
         no pause (and no error message is generated). Execution continues
         immediately with the next statement.

   Requires:
      If the script is not being run as a task, the BREAK statement is ignored
         (and no error message is generated). Execution continues with the next
         statement.
         
   Examples:
      SEND "drop treasure"
      BREAK
      SEND "bury treasure"
