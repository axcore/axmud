WAITHOOK expression [ , expression ]

   Synopsis:
      Creates a temporary hook and pauses until the hook fires

   Notes:
      The first expression is the hook stimulus (a hook event). The Axbasic 
         script will pause until the hook fires, at which point the hook is
         destroyed and execution of the Axbasic script resumes.
      The second expression is a timeout measured in seconds. If specified, the
         script gives up waiting for the hook after that period. The hook is
         destroyed and execution of the script resumes.

      If Axmud can't create the hook, execution of the script continues as
         normal (with no error message and no pause).
      Also see the help for SETHOOK.

   Requires:
      If the script is not being run as a task, the WAITHOOK statement is
         ignored (and no error message is generated). Execution continues with
         the next statement.
         
   Examples:
      WAITHOOK "receive_text"
      WAITHOOK "receive_text", 60
