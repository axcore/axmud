SORTCASE variable-name

   Synopsis:
      Sorts the cells in an array variable

   Notes:
      String arrays are sorted alphabetically. The sort operation is case-
         insensitive, so 'aardvark' will come before 'Zoo'. (Use the SORT
         statement if you want a case-sensitive sort opertion.)
      Numeric arrays are sorted in order of ascending value. With numeric
         arrays, SORT and SORTCASE produce the same output.
      Only one-dimensional arrays can be sorted. SORTCASE assumes that the array
         starts at element #1.
      Also see the help for SORTCASER, which sorts arrays in reverse order.

   Examples:
      DATA 'ant', 'Bat', 'cat', 'Dog', 'eagle'
      DIM stuff (5)

      ! Display the unsorted array
      FOR a = 1 TO 5
         READ stuff (a)
         PRINT stuff (a)
      NEXT a

      ! Display the sorted array
      SORTCASE stuff
      FOR a = 1 TO 5
         PRINT stuff (a)
      NEXT a
