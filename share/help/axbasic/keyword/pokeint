POKEINT axmud-object-property

   Synopsis:
      Sets the value of an Axmud internal scalar property to an integer

   Notes:
      POKE gives Axbasic scripts access to some of Axmud's internal data (see 
         the help for the POKE statement for a full explanation). 
      POKEINT is similar to POKE, but it only sets the value of scalar 
         properties such as "world.current.longName". It cannot be used to set a
         list property such as "world.current.doorPatternList", a hash property
         such as "world.current.currencyHash" or a Perl object such as
         "world.current".
      POKEINT modifies the value of the scalar property - a value which must be 
         numeric - by removing its fractional part, converting 3.1415 to 3 and 
         converting -2.7182 to -2. POKEINT is most useful after a POKEDIVIDE
         statement acts on scalar property that needs to be an integer.
      Much of Axmud's internal data is read-only, and cannot be modified with
         POKE or with this statement. If you try to modify a read-only property
         you will get an 'operation failure' error.

   Warning: 
      Do not try to modify Axmud's internal data unless you know what you are 
         doing. Read the Axmud manual before you try to POKE anything. (The
         examples below are safe, but backup your data first.)

   Examples:
      ! Halve the number of consecutive empty lines that are suppressed
      POKEDIVIDE "world.current.suppressEmptyLineCount", 2
      ! The value must be an integer!
      POKEINT "world.current.suppressEmptyLineCount"
