ON expression GOTO expression [ , expression ... ]
ON expression GOSUB expression [ , expression ... ]

   Synopsis:
      Selects a line number for the trailing GOTO or GOSUB statement

   Notes:
      The first expression should evaluate to a positive integer. The remaining
         expression(s) must evaluate to a line number. Complex expressions like
         '(x + 10) / 2' can be used as well as simple line numbers like 100.
      The use of ON-GOTO statements in your Axbasic scripts is strongly
         discouraged.
      In the first example below, the END statement is never executed. In the
         second example, it is the last statement to be executed.

   Availability:
      ON-GOTO and ON-GOSUB are only available in scripts with primitive line
          numbers.

   Examples:
      10 REM Generate a random number between 1 and 3
      20 LET num = int (rnd (3) + 1)
      30 ON num GOTO 100, 200, 300
      100 PRINT "Number 1!"
      110 STOP
      200 PRINT "Number 2!"
      210 STOP
      300 PRINT "Number 3!"
      310 STOP
      400 END

      10 REM Generate a random number between 1 and 3
      20 LET num = int (rnd (3) + 1)
      30 ON num GOSUB 100, 200, 300
      40 END
      100 PRINT "Number 1!"
      110 RETURN
      200 PRINT "Number 2!"
      210 RETURN
      300 PRINT "Number 3!"
      310 RETURN
