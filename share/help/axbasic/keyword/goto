GOTO expression

   Synopsis:
      Causes execution of the script to jump to the specified line number

   Notes:
      The expression must evaluate to a line number or an error will occur. 
         Complex expressions like '(x + 10) / 2' can be used as well as simple 
         line numbers like 100.
      The use of GOTO statements in your Axbasic scripts is strongly 
         discouraged.
      In the example below, the lines are executed in the order 10, 20, 100,
         110.
      See also the help for IF and ON.

   Availability:
      GOTO is only available in scripts with primitive line numbers.

   Examples:
      10 PRINT "Hello world!"
      20 GOTO 100
      30 PRINT "This line is never executed"
      100 PRINT "Goodbye cruel world!"
      110 END
