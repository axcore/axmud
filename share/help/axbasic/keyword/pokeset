POKESET axmud-object-property, expression
POKESET axmud-object-property

   Synopsis:
      Sets the value of an Axmud internal scalar property

   Notes:
      POKE gives Axbasic scripts access to some of Axmud's internal data (see
         the help for the POKE statement for a full explanation).
      POKESET is similar to POKE, but it only sets the value of scalar
         properties such as "world.current.longName". It cannot be used to set a
         list property such as "world.current.doorPatternList", a hash property
         such as "world.current.currencyHash" or a Perl object such as
         "world.current".
      POKESET sets the scalar property to the value of the expression. If you
         don't specify an expression, the scalar property is set to the Perl
         special value 'undef'. (Omitting the expression makes POKESET behave
         just like POKEUNDEF.)
      Much of Axmud's internal data is read-only, and cannot be modified with
         POKE or with this statement. If you try to modify a read-only property
         you will get an 'operation failure' error.

   Warning:
      Do not try to modify Axmud's internal data unless you know what you are
         doing. Read the Axmud manual before you try to POKE anything. (The
         examples below are safe, but backup your data first.)

   Examples:
      ! Set the current world's long name
      POKESET "world.current.longName", "My favourite mud in the whole world"
      ! Reset the current world's long name
      POKESET "world.current.longName"
