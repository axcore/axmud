DELHOOK expression

   Synopsis:
      Deletes an independent hook

   Notes:
      A convenient way to delete hooks created with the ADDHOOK statement. The
         expression is the name of the hook to delete.
      DELHOOK assumes that the hook is assigned to a cage belonging to the
         current world (unless an earlier PROFILE statement specified a
         different profile).
      The following Axbasic statements are therefore interchangeable:
      
         DELHOOK "name"
         CLIENT "deletehook name"
         
      If Axmud can't delete the hook, execution of the Axbasic script continues
         as normal. No error message is generated.

   Examples:
      DELHOOK "focushook"
