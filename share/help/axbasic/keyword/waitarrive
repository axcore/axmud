WAITARRIVE [ expression ]

   Synopsis:
      Pauses execution until the character has arrived

   Notes:
      When you send a movement command to the mud (like "north" or "enter 
         gate"), the Locator task is notified so it can keep track of how many
         room descriptions to expect.
      The WAITARRIVE statement pauses execution of the Axbasic script until the
         Locator task reports that it isn't expecting any more room 
         descriptions. If world commands have been queued, the Axbasic also 
         waits for them to be sent to the world (in case some of them are 
         movement commands).
      WAITARRIVE is normally used in combination with the statements MOVE, RELAY 
         or SEND.
      The expression is a timeout measured in seconds. If specified, the script
         gives up waiting after that period and resumes execution.
      If the Axbasic script isn't being run from within a task, the WAITARRIVE
         statement is ignored (and no error message is generated). Execution
         continues immediately with the next statement.
      If the Locator task isn't running or if it doesn't know anything about the
         character's current location, the Axbasic script pauses briefly and
         resumes execution on the next task loop.

   Examples:
      MOVE "north"
      WAITARRIVE

      MOVE "squeeze through curtains"
      WAITARRIVE 5
