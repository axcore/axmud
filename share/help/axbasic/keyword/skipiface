SKIPIFACE

   Synopsis:
      Marks the next interface notification as the current one

   Notes:
      Whenever a trigger created by a SETTRIG statement fires, an 'interface
         notification' is created.
      The interface notification list contains all the notifications received
         but not yet processed. One of them - usually the first one in the
         list - is the 'current' notification.
         
      Axbasic functions like IFACENAME$() and IFACENUM() can be used to import
         information about the trigger that caused the current notification.
      NEXTIFACE removes the current notification from the list, but SKIPIFACE
         retains it and simply moves on to the next notification in the list. In
         addition, whereas NEXTIFACE always moves to the first item in the list
         (if there is one), SKIPIFACE statements move sequentially through the
         list, in order, returning to the beginning when they reach the end of
         the list.
      If the list was already empty, execution continues as normal and no error
         message is generated. If the list contains only one notification, that
         notification remains the current one.
      See also the help for NEXTIFACE.

   Examples:
      SETTRIG "You are dead"

      IF IFACECOUNT() >= 2
         ! Get the name and number of the current interface notification
         LET $name = IFACENAME$()
         LET number = IFACENUM()

         ! Move on the next notification on the list
         SKIPIFACE
         LET $name2 = IFACENAME$()
         LET number2 = IFACENUM()
      END IF
