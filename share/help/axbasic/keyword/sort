SORT variable-name

   Synopsis:
      Sorts the cells in an array variable

   Notes:
      String arrays are sorted alphabetically. The sort operation is case-
         sensitive, so 'Zoo' will come before 'aardvark'. (Use the SORTCASE
         statement if you want a case-insensitive sort opertion.)
      Numeric arrays are sorted in order of ascending value.
      Only one-dimensional arrays can be sorted. SORT assumes that the array
         starts at element #1.
      Also see the help for SORTR, which sorts arrays in reverse order.

   Examples:
      DATA 40, 200, 77, 10
      DIM stuff (4)

      ! Display the unsorted array
      FOR a = 1 TO 4
         READ stuff (a)
         PRINT stuff (a)
      NEXT a

      ! Display the sorted array
      SORT stuff
      FOR a = 1 TO 4
         PRINT stuff (a)
      NEXT a
