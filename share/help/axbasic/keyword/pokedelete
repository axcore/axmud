POKEDELETE axmud-object-property, expression

   Synopsis:
      Deletes a key-value pair from an Axmud internal hash property

   Notes:
      POKE gives Axbasic scripts access to some of Axmud's internal data (see
         the help for the POKE statement for a full explanation).
      POKEDELETE is similar to POKE, but it only modifies hash properties such
         as "world.current.currencyHash". It cannot be used to modify a scalar
         property such as "world.current.longName", a list property such as
         "world.current.doorPatternList" or a Perl object such as
         "world.current".
      POKEDELETE removes a key-value pair from the hash property. 'expression'
         is a key which must exist in the hash. Both the key and its
         corresponding value are removed.
      Much of Axmud's internal data is read-only, and cannot be modified with
         POKE or with this statement. If you try to modify a read-only property
         you will get an 'operation failure' error.

   Warning:
      Do not try to modify Axmud's internal data unless you know what you are
         doing. Read the Axmud manual before you try to POKE anything. (The
         examples below are safe, but backup your data first.)

   Examples:
      ! Remove a unit of currency at the DeadSouls world profile
      POKEDELETE "world.current.currencyHash", "silver"
