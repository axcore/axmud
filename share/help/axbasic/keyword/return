RETURN expression
RETURN

   Synopsis:
      Returns from a subroutine

   Notes:
      In scripts without line numbers, the expression is evaluated and used as 
         the subroutine's return value.
      In scripts with line numbers, RETURN is used without an expression (and
         there is no return value).
      See the help for SUB for a full explanation.

   Examples:
      RETURN 10
      RETURN number

      10 GOSUB 100
      20 PRINT "Goodbye cruel world!"
      30 END
      100 PRINT "Hello world!"
      110 RETURN
