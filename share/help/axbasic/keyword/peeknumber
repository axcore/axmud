PEEKNUMBER variable-name = axmud-object-property
PEEKNUMBER ARRAY variable-name = axmud-object-property

   Synopsis:
      Fetches the size of an Axmud internal list property

   Notes:
      PEEK gives Axbasic scripts access to most of Axmud's internal data (see 
         the help for the PEEK statement for a full explanation).
      PEEKNUMBER can only be used with list properties such as 
         "world.current.doorPatternList". It cannot be used with a scalar 
         property such as "world.current.name", a hash property such as 
         "world.current.currencyHash" or a Perl object such as "world.current".
      'variable-name' is set to the size of the list property. If the list is 
         empty, the size is 0. If 'variable-name' is a string variable (or a 
         string array), a string value such as "3" is used.
         
   Examples:
      ! Store the size of a list property in an Axbasic global scalar variable
      PEEKNUMBER size = "world.current.doorPatternList"

      ! Store the size of a list property in an Axbasic global array
      PEEKNUMBER ARRAY sizes = "world.current.doorPatternList"
 
      ! Store the size of a list property in an Axbasic local scalar variable
      LOCAL size
      PEEKNUMBER size = "world.current.doorPatternList"
