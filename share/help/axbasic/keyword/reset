RESET #channel: BEGIN
RESET #channel: END

   Synopsis:
      Moves the pointer to the beginning or end of an open file

   Notes:
      The pointer is the position in a file at which Axbasic reads or write
         data.
      When a file is opened for reading only, the pointer is initially at the
         beginning of the file; the first item of data read is the first line in
         the file. When a file is opened for writing only, or for both reading
         and writing, the first item of data written is added to the end of the
         file. The RESET statement moves the pointer to the beginning or end of
         the file.

   Examples:
      ! Open a file for writing, appending new data to the end of the file
      OPEN #1: NAME "output.txt", CREATE NEWOLD, ACCESS OUTPUT
      PRINT #1: "This text is added to the end of the file"
      ! Now write some data at the beginning of the file
      RESET #1: BEGIN
      PRINT #1: "This text is added at the beginning of the file"
      CLOSE #1
      END
