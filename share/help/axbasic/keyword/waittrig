WAITTRIG expression [ , expression ]

   Synopsis:
      Creates a temporary trigger and pauses until the trigger fires

   Notes:
      The first expression is the trigger stimulus (a pattern). The Axbasic 
         script will pause until the trigger fires, at which point the trigger
         is destroyed and execution of the Axbasic script resumes.
      The second expression is a timeout measured in seconds. If specified, the
         script gives up waiting for the trigger after that period. The trigger
         is destroyed and execution of the script resumes.

      If Axmud can't create the trigger, execution of the script continues as
         normal (with no error message and no pause).
      Also see the help for SETTRIG.

   Requires:
      If the script is not being run as a task, the WAITTRIG statement is
         ignored (and no error message is generated). Execution continues with
         the next statement.
         
   Examples:
      WAITTRIG "The orc kills you"
      WAITTRIG "You kill the orc", 60
