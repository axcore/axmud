SPEED expression

   Synopsis:
      Executes a speedwalk command

   Notes:
      This is the equivalent of a speedwalk command typed in the 'main' window's
         command entry box.
      Speedwalking is a method of moving from one location in the world to
         another with a minimum of typing.
      The expression should be a string like "n" or "3nw2s". If the string
         starts with a full stop (period) character, the path is reversed.

      Extensive help for speedwalk commands is available by typing
         ';help speedwalk'.
      See also the help for PERL, MULTI and BYPASS.

   Examples:
      ! Move north once; these commands are equivalent
      MOVE "north"
      SPEED "n"

      ! Move several times; this group of commands...
      SEND "north"
      SEND "north"
      SEND "north"
      SEND "west"
      SEND "south"
      SEND "south"
      ! ...is the equivalent of this one
      SPEED "3nw2s"

      ! Go back to where you started
      SPEED ".3nw2s"
