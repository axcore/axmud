WINDELGAUGE expression

   Synopsis:
      Deletes a task window gauge

   Notes:
      Deletes a gauge that was added to the task window with a WINADDGAUGE or
         WINADDCONGAUGE statement.
      The expression is the gauge's unique number. If the gauge doesn't exist,
         the WINDELGAUGE statement is ignored, but the number isn't an integer,
         0 or above, you'll see an error message.

   Requires:
      If the script is not being run as a task, the WINDELGAUGE statement is
         ignored (and no error message is generated). Execution continues with
         the next statement.

   Examples:
      WINDELGAUGE 1
