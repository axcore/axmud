ADDTRIG expression , expression [ , expression ]

   Synopsis:
      Adds an independent trigger

   Notes:
      A convenient way to create triggers. The first expression is the stimulus
         (a pattern), the second is the response (an instruction or 
         substitution). If the third expression is specified, it is used as the
         trigger name; otherwise Axmud assigns a name to the trigger.
      The following Axbasic statements are therefore interchangeable:
      
         ADDTRIG "stimulus", "response", "name"
         CLIENT "addtrigger -s stimulus -p response -n name"
         
      If Axmud can't create the new trigger, execution of the Axbasic script
         continues as normal. No error message is generated.
      All triggers created by this statement are 'inactive' triggers, and are
         assigned to a cage belonging to the current world (unless an earlier
         PROFILE statement specified a different profile). If there are no 
         higher-priority triggers with the same name, the corresponding 'active' 
         trigger will be created automatically.
      Triggers created with this statement are automatically deleted when the
         script terminates (unless you use an OPTION PERSIST statement somewhere
         in the code).

   Examples:
      ADDTRIG "The orc kills you", "tell fred i am dead!", "deadtrig"
      ADDTRIG "^You attack the orc.$", ";starttask orctask"
