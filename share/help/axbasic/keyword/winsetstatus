WINSETSTATUS expression , expression , expression

   Synopsis:
      Updates a task window status bar

   Notes:
      Updates a status bar that was added to the task window with a WINADDSTATUS
         or WINADDCONSTATUS statement.
      The first expression is the status bar's unique number. If the status bar
         doesn't exist, the WINSETSTATUS statement is ignored, but the number
         isn't an integer, 0 or above, you'll see an error message.
      The second and third expressions should evaluate to numbers displayed in
         the status bar. Any decimal number is acceptable, even negative
         numbers. If these expressions don't evaluate to a number, a question
         mark is displayed in its place.
      After a WINADDSTATUS statement, the first number is expected (but not
         required) to be less than or equal to the second one. After a
         WINADDCONSTATUS statement, the sum of the two numbers is expected (but
         not required) to be constant, at least in the short term.

   Requires:
      If the script is not being run as a task, the WINSETSTATUS statement is
         ignored (and no error message is generated). Execution continues with
         the next statement.

   Examples:
      ! Character's health points are at 50%
      WINADDSTATUS 1, "HP"
      WINSETSTATUS 1, 50, 100

      ! Character's energy points are very low
      WINADDSTATUS 2, "EP"
      WINSETSTATUS 2, 0.017, 1

      ! Show a status bar where the two numbers are added
      ! Character has 900xp, and needs 100 more to level up
      WINADDCONSTATUS 3, "XP"
      WINSETSTATUS 3, 900, 100
