DELTIMER expression

   Synopsis:
      Deletes an independent timer

   Notes:
      A convenient way to delete timers created with the ADDTIMER statement. The
         expression is the name of the timer to delete.
      DELTIMER assumes that the timer is assigned to a cage belonging to the
         current world (unless an earlier PROFILE statement specified a
         different profile).
      The following Axbasic statements are therefore interchangeable:
      
         DELTIMER "name"
         CLIENT "deletetimer name"
         
      If Axmud can't delete the timer, execution of the Axbasic script continues
         as normal. No error message is generated.

   Examples:
      DELTIMER "invtimer"
