WAITTIMER expression [ , expression ]

   Synopsis:
      Creates a temporary timer and pauses until the timer fires

   Notes:
      The first expression is the timer pattern (an interval in seconds or a
         clock time in the form "HH:MM" or "99:MM"). The Axbasic script will
         pause until the timer fires, at which point the timer is destroyed and
         execution of the Axbasic script resumes.
      The second expression is a timeout measured in seconds. If specified, the
         script gives up waiting for the timer after that period. The timer is
         destroyed and execution of the script resumes.

      If Axmud can't create the timer, execution of the script continues as
         normal (with no error message and no pause).

      WAITTIMER is provided to complete the set (that also contains WAITTRIG,
         WAITALIAS, WAITMACRO and WAITHOOK). In almost all cases it would be
         better to use SLEEP instead.
      Also see the help for SETTIMER.

   Requires:
      If the script is not being run as a task, the WAITTIMER statement is
         ignored (and no error message is generated). Execution continues with
         the next statement.

   Examples:
      WAITTIMER 60
      WAITTIMER 60, 60

      REM Wait until lunch break
      WAITTIMER "13:00"
      REM Wait until the big hands points to six
      WAITTIMER "99:30"
