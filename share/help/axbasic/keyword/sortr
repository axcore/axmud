SORTR variable-name

   Synopsis:
      Sorts the cells in an array variable in reverse order.

   Notes:
      String arrays are sorted reverse-alphabetically. The sort operation is
         case-sensitive, so 'Aardvark' will come before 'zoo'. (Use the
         SORTCASER statement if you want a case-insensitive sort opertion.)
       Numeric arrays are sorted in order of descending value.
      Only one-dimensional arrays can be sorted. SORTR assumes that the array
         starts at element #1.
      Also see the help for SORT.

   Examples:
      DATA 40, 200, 77, 10
      DIM stuff (4)
      FOR a = 1 TO 4
         READ stuff (a)
      NEXT a

      SORTR stuff
      FOR a = 1 TO 4
         PRINT stuff (a)
      NEXT a
