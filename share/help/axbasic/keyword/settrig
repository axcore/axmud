SETTRIG expression [ , expression ]

   Synopsis:
      Adds a dependent trigger

   Notes:
      A convenient way to create a trigger that launches another Axbasic script
         (or notifies this script's parent task) whenever it fires.
         
      The first expression is the stimulus (a pattern). Axmud automatically
         assigns a own name to dependent triggers.
      If the second expression is specified, it should be the name of an Axbasic
         script to run immediately (without a parent task) when the trigger
         fires.
      If the second expression is omitted, this script's parent task receives a
         notification when the trigger fires. Axbasic provides several intrinsic
         (built-in) functions for getting information about these notifiacations
         (see the help for NEXTIFACE for more information).
      Also see the help for WAITTRIG.

   Examples:
      SETTRIG "The orc kills you"
      SETTRIG "You are ready to cross the bridge!", "cross_bridge"
