INPUT [ constant ; ] variable-name [ , variable-name ... ]
INPUT #channel: variable-name [ , variable-name ... ]

   Synopsis:
      Prompts the user to input data or reads data from a file

   Notes:
      The first form of the INPUT statement prompts the user to enter one or 
         more items of data, which are stored in the specified variables.
      The string constant, if specified, is displayed as a prompt to the user;
         otherwise no prompt is displayed.
      If the script is being run from within a task, and if a task window with
         its own entry box is open, the user's response can be typed there.
         Otherwise, Axmud will open a popup window for each value expected. The
         values are stored in the specified variable(s).
      If you type nothing in the entry box, string variables are given the value
         "" (an empty string) and numeric variables are given the value 0.

      The second form of the INPUT statement reads data from a file channel
         created with an earlier OPEN statement. If the file channel is closed, 
         if it was opened in write-only mode or if the end-of-file has already
         been reached, an error is generated. 

   Examples:
      ! Prompt the user for input
      INPUT name$
      INPUT "Enter your name"; name$
      INPUT "Enter your date of birth DD MM YYYY"; day, month, year
      END

      ! Read data from a file
      OPEN #1: NAME "myfile.txt"
      INPUT #1: title$
      INPUT #1: question$, answer$
      CLOSE #1
      END
