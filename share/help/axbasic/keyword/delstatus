DELSTATUS expression

   Synopsis:
      Deletes a 'main' window status bar

   Notes:
      Deletes a status bar that was added to the 'main' window with an ADDSTATUS
         or ADDCONSTATUS statement.
      The expression is the status bar's unique number. If the status bar
         doesn't exist, the DELSTATUS statement is ignored, but the number isn't
         an integer, 0 or above, you'll see an error message.

   Requires:
      If the script is not being run as a task, the DELSTATUS statement is
         ignored (and no error message is generated). Execution continues with
         the next statement.

   Examples:
      DELSTATUS 1
