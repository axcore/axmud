DELSTATUS expression
    
   Synopsis:
      Deletes a 'main' window status bar
    
   Notes:
      Deletes a status bar that was added to the 'main' window with an ADDSTATUS
         or ADDCONSTATUS statement.
      The expression is the status bar's unique number. If the status bar
         doesn't exist, the DELSTATUS statement is ignored, but the number isn't
         an integer, 0 or above, you'll see an error message.

   Examples:
      DELSTATUS 1
