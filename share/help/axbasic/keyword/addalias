ADDALIAS expression , expression [ , expression ]
    
   Synopsis:
      Adds an independent alias
    
   Notes:
      A convenient way to create aliases. The first expression is the stimulus
         (a pattern), the second is the response (a subsitution). If the third
         expression is specified, it is used as the alias name; otherwise Axmud
         assigns a name to the alias.
      The following Axbasic statements are therefore interchangeable:
      
         ADDALIAS "stimulus", "response", "name"
         CLIENT "addalias -s stimulus -p response -n name"
         
      If Axmud can't create the new alias, execution of the Axbasic script
         continues as normal. No error message is generated.
      All aliases created by this statement are 'inactive' aliases, and are
         assigned to a cage belonging to the current world (unless an earlier 
         PROFILE statement specified a different profile). If there are no 
         higher-priority aliases with the same name, the corresponding 'active' 
         alias will be created automatically.
      Aliases created with this statement are automatically deleted when the
         script terminates (unless you use an OPTION PERSIST statement somewhere
         in the code).
    
   Examples:
      ADDALIAS "^sw$", "sail west", "sailalias"
      ADDALIAS "^lb$", "leave boat"
