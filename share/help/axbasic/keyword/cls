CLS

   Synopsis:
      Empties the task window

   Notes:
      If the Axbasic script isn't being run from within a task, the CLS 
         statement is ignored (and no error message is generated). Execution 
         continues immediately with the next statement.
      CLS has exactly the same functionality as EMPTYWIN.
      If you want to empty text in the 'main' window, you can use the client 
         command ';cls'.

   Examples:
      ! Empty the task window
      CLS

      ! Empty the 'main' window
      CLIENT "cls"
