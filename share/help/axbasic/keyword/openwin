OPENWIN

   Synopsis:
      Opens a task window

   Notes:
      If the script is being run from within a task, this statement asks the
         task to open a task window.
      If the Axbasic script isn't being run from within a task, or if the task
         window is already open, the OPENWIN statement is ignored (and no error
         message is generated). Execution continues immediately with the next
         statement.
      Use the WRITEWIN statement to display text in the task window.
      Use the OPENENTRY statement to open a task with an entry (input) box.

   Examples:
      OPENWIN
      WRITEWIN "Hello world!"
      PAUSE 5
      CLOSEWIN
