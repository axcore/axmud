OPENWIN

   Synopsis:
      Opens a task window

   Notes:
      If the script is being run from within a task, this statement asks the
         task to open a task window.
      Use the WRITEWIN statement to display text in the task window.
      Use the OPENENTRY statement to open a task with an entry (input) box.

   Requires:
      If the script is not being run as a task, or if the task window is already
         open, the OPENWIN statement is ignored (and no error message is
         generated). Execution continues with the next statement.
         
   Examples:
      OPENWIN
      WRITEWIN "Hello world!"
      PAUSE 5
      CLOSEWIN
