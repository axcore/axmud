WAITDEAD [ expression ]

   Synopsis:
      Pauses execution until the character's life status is 'dead'

   Notes:
      The Status task recognises four states of being for the character:
         "alive", "sleep", "passout" and "dead". Whenever the character is not
         asleep, passed out or dead, they're considered alive.
      The expression is a timeout measured in seconds. If specified, the script
         gives up waiting after that period and resumes execution.
      If the Axbasic script isn't being run from within a task, the WAITDEAD
         statement is ignored (and no error message is generated). Execution
         continues immediately with the next statement.
         
      WAITDEAD relies on the Status task to supply the character's current life
         status. If the Status task is not running, the Axbasic script pauses
         pauses briefly and resumes execution on the next task loop.
      If the Status task doesn't know about the character's status, it assumes
         that the character is alive.
