SETMACRO expression [ , expression ]

   Synopsis:
      Adds a dependent macro

   Notes:
      A convenient way to create a macro that launches another Axbasic script
         (or notifies this script's parent task) whenever it fires.
         
      The first expression is the stimulus (a keycode string). When the user
         presses the key(s) matching the keycode string, the macro fires.
      (Axmud automatically assigns its own name to dependent macros.)
      
      If the second expression is specified, it should be the name of an Axbasic
         script to run immediately (without a parent task) when the macro
         fires.
      If the second expression is omitted, this script's parent task receives a
         notification when the macro fires. Axbasic provides several intrinsic
         (built-in) functions for getting information about these notifiacations
         (see the help for NEXTIFACE for more information).
      Also see the help for WAITMACRO.

   Requires:
      If the script is not being run as a task, a SETMACRO statement without a
         second expression (specifying another script to run) is ignored (and no
         error message is generated). Execution continues with the next
         statement.
         
   Compatibility:
      Since Axbasic v1.4
      
   Examples:
      SETMACRO "ctrl f1"
      SETMACRO "ctrl f1", "cross_bridge"
