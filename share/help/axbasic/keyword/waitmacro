WAITMACRO expression [ , expression ]

   Synopsis:
      Creates a temporary macro and pauses until the macro fires

   Notes:
      The first expression is the macro stimulus (a keycode). The Axbasic script
         will pause until the macro fires, at which point the macro is destroyed
         and execution of the Axbasic script resumes.
      The second expression is a timeout measured in seconds. If specified, the
         script gives up waiting for the macro after that period. The macro is
         destroyed and execution of the script resumes.

      If Axmud can't create the macro, execution of the script continues as
         normal (with no error message and no pause).
      Also see the help for SETMACRO.

   Requires:
      If the script is not being run as a task, the WAITMACRO statement is
         ignored (and no error message is generated). Execution continues with
         the next statement.
         
   Examples:
      WAITMACRO "f1"
      WAITMACRO "f1", 60
