WAITALIAS expression [ , expression ]

   Synopsis:
      Creates a temporary alias and pauses until the alias fires

   Notes:
      The first expression is the alias stimulus (a pattern). The Axbasic script
         will pause until the alias fires, at which point the alias is destroyed
         and execution of the Axbasic script resumes.
      The second expression is a timeout measured in seconds. If specified, the
         script gives up waiting for the alias after that period. The alias is
         destroyed and execution of the script resumes.

      If Axmud can't create the alias, execution of the script continues as
         normal (with no error message and no pause).
      Also see the help for SETALIAS.

   Requires:
      If the script is not being run as a task, the WAITALIAS statement is
         ignored (and no error message is generated). Execution continues with
         the next statement.

   Examples:
      WAITALIAS "^continue$"
      WAITTRIG "^continue$", 60
