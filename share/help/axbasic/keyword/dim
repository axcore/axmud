   Synopsis:
      Creates array variable(s) with the specified size and dimensions

   Notes:
      In scripts without primitive line numbers, all arrays are global by
         default, so DIM and DIM GLOBAL statements are interchangeable.
      In scripts with primitive line numbers, arrays are always global and only
         DIM statements can be used to created them.
         
      In scripts without line numbers, DIM GLOBAL and DIM LOCAL can be used as
         well as DIM. Since arrays are global by default, DIM GLOBAL and DIM
         statements are interchangeable.
      An array must be created with a DIM statement before it can be used in
         your script.
      The expressions in the argument list(s) must evaluate to positive integers 
         (so, Axbasic numbers its cells from 1, unlike most programming 
         languages which number their cells from 0).
      Axbasic arrays have a maximum size of 1,000,000 cells.

   Examples:
      ! An array containing 5 cells
      DIM myarray (5)
      ! Store a value in the first cell
      LET myarray (1) = 3.14

      ! A two-dimensional (10x10) array containing 100 cells
      DIM LOCAL newarray (10, 10)
      LET newarray (1, 2) = 99

      ! The biggest array Axbasic allows
      LET limit = 1000
      DIM GLOBAL bigarray (limit, limit)
