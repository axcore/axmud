PEEKFIRST variable-name = axmud-object-property
PEEKFIRST ARRAY variable-name = axmud-object-property

   Synopsis:
      Stores the value of the first element in an Axmud internal list property

   Notes:
      PEEK gives Axbasic scripts access to most of Axmud's internal data (see 
         the help for the PEEK statement for a full explanation).
      PEEKFIRST can only be used with list properties such as 
         "world.current.doorPatternList". It cannot be used with a scalar 
         property such as "world.current.name", a hash property such as 
         "world.current.currencyHash" or a Perl object such as "world.current".
      'variable-name' is set to the value of the first element of the list 
         property. If the list is empty, then a string variable will be set to 
         an empty string and a numeric variable will be set to 0. If the value 
         of the first element is the Perl special value 'undef', a string 
         variable will be set to "<<undef>>" and a numeric variable will be set 
         to 0.
                  
   Examples:
      ! Get the first pattern stored in the current world's door pattern list
      ! and store it in an Axbasic global scalar variable
      PEEKFIRST pattern$ = "world.current.doorPatternList"
      PRINT pattern$
      
      ! Store the first pattern in an Axbasic global array
      PEEKFIRST ARRAY patterns$ = "world.current.doorPatternList"
 
      ! Store the first pattern in an Axbasic local scalar variable 
      LOCAL pattern$
      PEEKFIRST pattern$ = "world.current.doorPatternList"
