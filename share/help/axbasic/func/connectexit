Connectexit (number, number)

   Synopsis:
      Connects an exit to a room

   Notes:
      The first number is the number of the exit; the second is the number of
         the room.
      Returns 0 on failure (for example, if the exit is already connected to a
         room). Returns 1 on success.

   Examples:
      Connectexit (1, 2)   >> Connects exit #1 to room #2
