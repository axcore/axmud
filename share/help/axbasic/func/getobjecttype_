Getobjecttype$ (number)
        
   Synopsis:
      Returns the type of an object in the Locator task's current room

   Notes:
      The task's current room has a numbered list of objects; 'number' is the
         position of an object in that list (the first object is numbered 1).
      The return value is the object's type (or category) which will be one of
         the following strings: "weapon", "armour", "garment", "char" for
         characters, "minion", "sentient", "creature", "portable", "decoration"
         or "custom".
      If the Locator task isn't running, if it doesn't know about the current
         location or if the numbered object doesn't exist, the return value is
         an empty string.
      To get the number of objects in the curent location, see the
         Getroomobjects () function.
