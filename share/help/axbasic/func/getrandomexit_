Getrandomexit$ (string)

   Synopsis:
      Gets the type of random exit

   Notes:
      'Random' exits have more than one possible destination. The world may
         choose a random destination, each time your character goes through the
         exit, or the destination may depend on the game state.

      This function retrieves the type of a random exit, that was created by an
         earlier call to Setrandomexit() (or that was created manually in the
         automapper window).

      Returns one of the values "same", "any", "temp", "room" or "none".
      The values "same", "any" and "temp" correspond to the values used in calls
         to Setrandomexit().
      The value "room" specifies a list of room numbers, any of which might be
         the exit's destination. This type of random exit can't be created by
         Axbasic, but can be created manually in the automapper window.
      The value "none" is returned if the exit is not a random exit, or if the
         exit doesn't exist.
