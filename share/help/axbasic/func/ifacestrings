Ifacestrings ()

   Synopsis:
      Returns the number of items of additional data provided by the interface
         when it fired
         
   Notes:
      The interface notification list contains all the notifications received,
         and not yet processed, as the result of an earlier SETTRIG, SETALIAS,
         SETMACRO, SETTIMER or SETHOOK statement.
      This function operates on the current notification (usually the first one;
         see the help for SKIPIFACE).

      The Ifacetext$ () function returns whatever caused the interface to fire.
         Some interfaces provide additional data when they fire, but some do
         not. The help for Ifacedefined () contains more information about this.
         
      This function returns how many pieces of additional data were provided. If
         the notification list is empty, returns 0.

   Compatibility:
      Since Axbasic v1.4, this function no longer returns -1 if the notification
         list is empty.
