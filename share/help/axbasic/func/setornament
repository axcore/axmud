Setornament (number)
Setornament (number, string)

   Synopsis:
      Sets an exit's ornament

   Notes:
      Exit ornaments give more information about an exit, and are drawn in a
         different way by the automapper.
      This function adds or removes an exit ornament from an exit.

      'number' is the number of the exit in the exit model.

      'string', if specified, is the type of ornament. Only the following
         ornaments can be set with this function.
      "break" is an exit such as a locked door, which can be broken down by your
         character (perhaps using a crowbar or some such tool).
      "pick" is an exit such as a locked door, which must be picked by your
         character (perhaps using a lockpick).
      "open" is an exit such as a door, which can be opened or closed.
      "lock" is an exit such as a door, which can be locked or unlocked (as well
         as being opened or closed).
      "impass" is an impassable exit; it exists in the world, but the character
         can never actually travel through it.
      "mystery" is an exit whose destination the user doesn't know, but which
         might not be impassable in certain situations.

      If you don't specify 'string' at all, then the exit ornament is removed.
      If this exit is one half of a pair of twin exits (such as a two-way exit),
         then this function acts on both of them simultaneously.
      Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure (including when you specify an invalid
         'string').
