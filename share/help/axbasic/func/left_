Left$ (string, length)

   Synopsis:
      Returns a string within a string, starting from the beginning

   Notes:
      If length is 0, an empty string is returned. If length is greater than the
         length of string, the whole string is returned. If length is a negative
         number, an error is generated.

   Examples:
      ! Return the first 4 characters in the string
      Left$ ("Read my lips", 5)
