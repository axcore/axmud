Epoch ()

   Synopsis:
      Returns the number of seconds since the system's epoch time

   Notes:
      On most systems, the epoch time is 00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970. One
         notable exception is MacOS Classic, which uses the epoch time
         00:00:00, January 1, 1904 in the current local time zone for its epoch.
