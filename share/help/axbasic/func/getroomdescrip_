GETROOMDESCRIP$ ()
GETROOMDESCRIP$ (string)
 
   Synopsis:
      Returns the verbose description of the automapper's current room

   Notes:
      Verbose descriptions are returned as a single string.
      'string' is one of world model's recognised light statuses (the default
         light status is "day"). If 'string' is not specified, returns the
         verbose description matching the current light status.
      If there is no current room or if the room doesn't have a verbose 
         description stored that matches the light status, returns an empty 
         string.
      To get the current light status, see the GETLIGHT$ function.
