Getroomsource$ ()
 
   Synopsis:
      Returns the source code path of the automapper's current room

   Notes:
      For users that have administrative privileges in the world, the rooms in
         Axmud's world model can be linked to the corresponding file path in the
         world's mudlib.
      If the current room's 'virtual' area path is set, it is returned, but if
         not, the source code path for the room is returned. If neither are set 
         for the current room, an empty string is returned.
