Ifaceselect$ (number)

   Synopsis:
      Returns the specified item of additional data provided by the interface
         when it fired

   Notes:
      The interface notification list contains all the notifications received,
         and not yet processed, as the result of an earlier SETTRIG, SETALIAS,
         SETMACRO, SETTIMER or SETHOOK statement.
      This function operates on the current notification (usually the first one;
         see the help for SKIPIFACE).

      The Ifacetext$ () function returns whatever caused the interface to fire.
         Some interfaces provide additional data when they fire, but some do
         not. The help for Ifacedefined () contains more information about this.
      This function returns the specified item of additional data. The first
         item is numbered 1, the second is numbered 2, and so on.
      If the specified item doesn't exist in the notification, or if there
         is no current notification, returns an empty string.


          the first remaining item of additional data, and
         returns it. You can call Ifaceshift$ () repeatedly until there is no
         more additional data to remove.


      This function is designed for use with triggers and aliases. If the
         notification was generated by a macro, timer or hook, an empty string
         is always returned.

      Matching a pattern against some text can generate some group substrings,
         if the pattern itself specifies one or more groups.
      The specified substring is returned. The first substring is numbered 1,
         the second is numbered 2, and so on.
      If the specified item doesn't exist, or if the notification list is empty,
         returns an empty string.
