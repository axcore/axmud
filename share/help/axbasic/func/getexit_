Getexit$ (number)

   Synopsis:
      Returns the name of an exit in the automapper's current room

   Notes:
      'number' is the position of the exit in the room's ordered list of exits
         (the first exit is numbered 1).
      If the automapper window isn't open, if there is no current room or if the
         numbered exit doesn't exist, returns an empty string.
      To get the current room's number of exits, see the Getroomexits ()
         function (which gets the exit's actual direction). To get the direction
         in which the exit is actually drawn on the map, see the
         Getexitdrawn$ () function.
