Getornament$ (string)

   Synopsis:
      Gets the type of exit ornament

   Notes:
      Exit ornaments give more information about an exit, and are drawn in a
         different way by the automapper.

      This function retrieves an exit's ornament, returning one of the values
         "break", "pick", "lock", "open", "impass", "mystery" or "none",
         corresponding to the values used in calls to Setornament().
      The value "none" is returned if the exit has no ornament, or if it
         doesn't exist.
