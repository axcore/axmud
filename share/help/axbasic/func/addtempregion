ADDTEMPREGION ()
ADDTEMPREGION (string)
        
   Synopsis:
      Adds a new temporary region to the world model

   Notes:
      Temporary regions are deleted automatically at the end of the session.
         'string' is the name of the new region. If a name isn't specified,
         Axbasic will allocate a name to the region (in the form 'temp_x'). The 
         automapper window will be automatically updated, if it is open.
      If the operation is successful, the new region's world model number is
         returned. If the operation fails, 0 is returned.
      To add a permanent region, see the ADDREGION function.
