Setrandomexit (number)
Setrandomexit (number, string)

   Synopsis:
      Sets a random exit

   Notes:
      'Random' exits have more than one possible destination. The world may
         choose a random destination, each time your character goes through the
         exit, or the destination may depend on the game state.

      This function converts a non-random exit into a random exit, or
         vice-versa.

      'number' is the number of the exit in the exit model.

      'string', if specified, is the type of random exit. Only three types can
         be set with this function.
      "same" creates a random exit, leading to a room in the same region.
      "any" creates a random exit, leading to a room in any region.
      "temp" creates a random exit in a temporary region. The temporary region
         is created, whenever your character goes through the exit.

      If you don't specify 'string' at all, then the random exit is converted
         back to a non-random exit.
      Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure (including when you specify an invalid
         'string').
