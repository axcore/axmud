MATCHI (string, regex)

   Synopsis:
      MATCH is an Axbasic pattern-matching function, comparing a Perl regular
         expression (regex) with a string to see whether the pattern matches

   Notes:
      'regex' is a Perl regular expression like "orc", "^orc" or "^orc (.*)$".
         If this pattern matches the string, MATCHI returns 1; otherwise it
         returns 0.
      MATCHI behaves just like MATCH, except that for MATCHI, the pattern-
         matching operation is case insensitive (equivalent to the Perl
         expression 'm/.../i').
