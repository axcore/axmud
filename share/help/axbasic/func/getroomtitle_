Getroomtitle$ ()

   Synopsis:
      Returns the title of the automapper's current room

   Notes:
      In some worlds, the room's title corresponds to its brief description.
      If more than one room title is stored, returns the first one.
      If there is no current room or if the room doesn't a title set, returns an
         empty string.
