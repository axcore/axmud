SETREGIONNUM (number)

   Synopsis:
      Sets the automapper's current region

   Notes:
      'number' is the region's world model number.
      Returns 1 if the region is set (or if it is already the current region).
         Returns 0 if the region is not set or if the automapper window isn't
         open.
      To set the current region using the region's name, see the SETREGION
         functon.
