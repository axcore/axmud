GETROOMOBJECTS ()
GETROOMOBJECTS (string)

   Synopsis:
      Returns the number of objects in the Locator task's current location

   Notes:
      If 'string' is specified, only the number of matching objects is returned. 
         'string' can be any category of world model object that a room can
         contain: "weapon", "armour", "garment", "char" (for characters),
         "minion", "sentient", "creature", "portable", "decoration" or
         "custom".
      'string' can also be set to "living" (in which case the number of living
         things is returned, whatever their category) or "not_living" (in which
         case the number of non-living things is returned).
      If the Locator task isn't running, if it doesn't know the current
         location, if the location seems to be empty or if an unrecognised
         'string' is specified, returns 0.
