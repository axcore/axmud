GETLIGHT$ ()

   Synopsis:
      Returns the world model's light status

   Notes:
      The rooms in the world model can have several stored descriptions, each
         corresponding to a different light level (the default 'light status'
         strings are "day", "night" and "dark".)
      This function gets the current light status. To set the current light
         status, see the SETLIGHT function.
