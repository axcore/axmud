ADDREGION (string)
        
   Synopsis:
      Adds a new region to the world model

   Notes:
      'string' is the name of the new region. The automapper window will be
         automatically updated, if it is open.
      If the operation is successful, the new region's world model number is
         returned. If the operation fails, 0 is returned.
      To add a temporary region that will automatically be deleted at the end of
         the session, see the ADDTEMPREGION function.
