SHOWPROFILE ()

   Synopsis:
      Shows which profile is being used by ADDTRIG and DELTRIG (etc) statements

   Notes:
      ADDTRIG and DELTRIG (etc) assume that the trigger belongs to the current
         world unless the PROFILE statement has been used. This function returns
         the name of the assumed profile; it's useful for checking that the 
         PROFILE statement worked.
