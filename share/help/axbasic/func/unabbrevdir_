UNABBREVDIR$ (string)
        
   Synopsis:
      Returns the unabbreviated form of a direction

   Notes:
      The current dictionary stores a number of custom primary and secondary
         directions, in both abbreviated and unabbreviated forms. 
      If 'string' is stored there as an abbreviated direction, returns the
         unabbreviated form; otherwise, returns 'string' unmodified.
