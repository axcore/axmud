Getobjectcount (number)

   Synopsis:
      Returns the number of (real) world objects stored in a single model object

   Notes:
      The Locator task's current room has a numbered list of objects; 'number'
         is the position of an object in that list (the first object is numbered
         1).
      When the world sends some text like '10 gold coins', Axmud is able to
         store it in a single model object whose 'multiple' property is set to
         10. For most objects, the 'multiple' property is set to 1. This
         function returns the value stored in the object's 'multiple' property.
      If the Locator task isn't running, if it doesn't know about the current
         location or if the numbered object doesn't exist, 0 is returned.
      To get the number of objects in the curent location, see the
         Getroomobjects () function.
