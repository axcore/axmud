GETOBJECT$ (number)
        
   Synopsis:
      Returns a string describing an object in the Locator task's current room

   Notes:
      The task's current room has a numbered list of objects; 'number' is the
         position of an object in that list (the first object is numbered 1).
      The return value is the object's base string, e.g. "big hairy orc".
      If the Locator task isn't running, if it doesn't know about the current
         location, if the numbered object doesn't exist or if the object hasn't
         had its base string set, an empty string is returned.
      To get the number of objects in the curent location, see the
         GETROOMOBJECTS function.
