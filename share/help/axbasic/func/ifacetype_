Ifacetype$ ()

   Synopsis:
      Returns the type of the current interface notification

   Notes:
      The interface notification list contains all the notifications received,
         and not yet processed, as the result of an earlier SETTRIG statement.
      At present, only triggers produce interface notifications, so only the
         string "trigger" is returned. If there is no current notification,
         returns an empty string.
