Getobjectalive (number)
        
   Synopsis:
      Tests whether an object is considered alive

   Notes:
      The Locator task's current room has a numbered list of objects; 'number' 
         is the position of an object in that list (the first object is numbered 
         1).
      This function returns 1 if the object is considered alive, 0 if it is not.
      If the Locator task isn't running, if it doesn't know about the current
         location or if the numbered object doesn't exist, 0 is returned.
      To get the number of objects in the curent location, see the
         Getroomobjects () function.
