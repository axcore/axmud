<h2><a name="1.1">1.1 Axmud routes</a></h2>
<p>Players often use aliases to move between two rooms. For example, to move between a shop and a bank, a player might create two aliases called</p>
<pre><code>    shop2bank
    bank2shop
</code></pre>
<p>Creating aliases is one way to do it - but there's a better way!</p>
<hr>
<p>Routes are a fixed path between two rooms. To create an alias, you could type</p>
<pre><code>    ;addalias shop2bank w;w;n;nw;w;w;w;s
    ;addalias bank2shop n;e;e;e;se;s;e;e
</code></pre>
<p>To create a route, you should type</p>
<pre><code>    ;addroute shop bank w;w;n;nw;w;w;w;s
    ;addroute bank shop n;e;e;e;se;s;e;e
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, for very long routes you might prefer to use speedwalk commands (in the Guide, see <a href="ch04.html#4.4.5">Section 4.4.5</a>)</p>
<pre><code>    ;addalias shop2bank .2wn(nw)3ws
    ;addroute shop bank .2wn(nw)3ws
</code></pre>
<p>Speedwalk commands are really useful because you can reverse the path just by adding a full stop/period at the beginning.</p>
<pre><code>    ;addroute shop bank ..2wn(nw)3ws
</code></pre>
<h2><a name="1.2">1.2 Adding routes using an edit window</a></h2>
<p>If you prefer clicking over typing, then you can add routes using an edit window:</p>
<ul>
<li>From the main window's menu, click <strong>Interfaces &gt; Routes &gt; World routes... &gt; Routes &gt; Page 1</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Start room tag</strong> box, type <strong>shop</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Stop room tag box</strong>, type <strong>bank</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Route</strong> box, type <strong>.2wn(nw)3ws</strong></li>
<li>Click <strong>Add route</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Creating the reverse route is just as simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>First swap <strong>shop</strong> and <strong>bank</strong></li>
<li>Then put an extra full stop/period before the speedwalk command, i.e. <strong>..2wn(nw)3ws</strong></li>
<li>Then click the <strong>Add route</strong> button again</li>
<li>When you've finished, click the <strong>OK</strong> button to close the window</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="1.3">1.3 Moving with routes</a></h2>
<p>To move between the shop and the bank, you can now type</p>
<pre><code>    ;drive shop bank
</code></pre>
<p>To move in the opposite direction, you can now type</p>
<pre><code>    ;drive bank shop
</code></pre>
<h2><a name="1.4">1.4 Types of route</a></h2>
<p>Actually, there are three types of route. The ones you just created are called road routes. A road route represents a path between two rooms that uses main roads, marked paths, and so on.</p>
<p>The opposite of a road route is a quick route, which represents a shorter path between two rooms. The path is shorter because you don't stick to using main roads and marked paths.</p>
<p>To add a quick route from the edit window, find the <strong>Routes type</strong> box and select <strong>quick</strong>; then repeat the process above.</p>
<p>You can create both a road route and a short route between the same two rooms. If so, take the road route by typing</p>
<pre><code>    ;road bank shop
</code></pre>
<p>Take the quick route by typing </p>
<pre><code>    ;quick bank shop
</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>;drive</strong> command tells Axmud to use a road route, if it exists, and otherwise to use a quick route.</p>
<h2><a name="1.5">1.5 Circuit routes</a></h2>
<p>The third type of route is called a circuit route. </p>
<p>Circuit routes begin and end in the same room. If you're hunting an NPC which spawns at a random location in a zone, you could create a circuit around the zone, and then type</p>
<pre><code>    ;circuit myroute
</code></pre>
<p>If it's a long route, you could create a temporary trigger so you don't miss the NPC when you pass him. For example, to look out for trolls:</p>
<pre><code>    ;sound on
    ;addtrigger -s troll -p ;beep -t 1
</code></pre>
<p>(Of course, it's a lot easier to create triggers from the edit window; in the Guide, see <a href="ch07.html#7.1">Section 7.1</a>.)</p>
<h2><a name="1.6">1.6 Combining routes</a></h2>
<p>Now we get to the really clever part. </p>
<pre><code>    SHOP === BANK === GUILD ROOM
</code></pre>
<p>Let's assume that you've created a route between the shop and the bank, and that you've created another route between the bank and the guild room. </p>
<p>If you want to travel directly between the shop and the guild room, there is no need to create a third route; you can just type</p>
<pre><code>    ;drive shop guildroom
</code></pre>
<p>...which is the same as typing</p>
<pre><code>    ;drive shop bank
    ;drive bank guildroom
</code></pre>
<p>Axmud automatically combines routes to find the shortest path, even if that means checking dozens or hundreds of different routes.</p>
<h2><a name="1.7">1.7 Hoppable routes</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes a route might be blocked by a natural hazard or an NPC. In either case, you won't want Axmud to combine this route with other routes.</p>
<p>Routes are hoppable by default, which means that Axmud can hop between routes to reach its desination. If you don't want a route to be hoppable, just deselect the check button in the edit window.</p>
<h2><a name="1.8">1.8 Omitting the start room</a></h2>
<p>Another useful feature is that you only need to type the start room once. In other words, if you</p>
<pre><code>    ;drive shop bank
</code></pre>
<p>...then you don't need to type</p>
<pre><code>    ;drive bank guildroom
</code></pre>
<p>...because Axmud already knows that you're at the bank; instead, you can just type</p>
<pre><code>    ;drive guildroom
</code></pre>
<h2><a name="1.9">1.9 Making use of the automapper</a></h2>
<p><img alt="An example map" src="img/tut01/example_map.png"></p>
<p>You can use the automapper to add room tags to a room (right click the room, then click <strong>Set room text &gt; Set room tag...</strong> )</p>
<p>If the automapper knows you're at a room tagged as <strong>BANK</strong>, then you don't need to type the start room; just tell Axmud where you want to go.</p>
<pre><code>    ;drive guildroom
</code></pre>
<p>Routes are completely independent of the automapper. Of course, if you have drawn a nice map, then you don't need to use routes at all; just tell Axmud to</p>
<pre><code>    ;go guildroom
</code></pre>
