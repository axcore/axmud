Axmud is known to work on MS Windows, Linux and *BSD. It might be possible to
install it on other systems such as MacOS, but the authors have not been able to
confirm this yet.

After installation (see the INSTALL file), visually-impaired users can run this
script:

    baxmud.pl

Other users can run this script:

    axmud.pl

Using either script, you can specify a world to which Axmud connects immediately:

    axmud.pl empiremud.net 4000

If you omit the port number, Axmud connects using the generic port 23:

    axmud.pl elephant.org

If a world profile already exists, you can specify its name instead:

    axmud.pl cryosphere

Note that window tiling and multiple desktop support has not been implemented on
MS Windows yet.
