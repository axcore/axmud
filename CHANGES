v1.1.174 (30 Sep 2018)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Major new features
- Axmud can now be run on on *BSD
- Axmud releases are now available as an .RPM package
- The installation guide (the INSTALL file) has been greatly expanded
- The Axmud Guide and the Quick Help document have been converted to HTML, and
    can now be read on the Axmud website. Markdown versions of the text can also
    be found in /share/docs. The PDF/ODT version of the Axmud Guide have been
    removed
- Added support for ZMP (Zenith Mud protocol). The new 'zmptest' plugin
    demonstrates how additional ZMP packages can be written. New client commands
    ';zmp', 'sendzmp' and ';imputzmp'
- Added support for AARD102 (Aardwolf 102 channels). New client command
    ';aardwolf'
- Added full support for MCP v2.1 (Mud Client Protocol). The implementation
    includes the 'dns-org-mud-moo-simpleedit' package. The new 'mcptest' plugin
    demonstrates how additional MCP packages can be written. New client command
    ';mcp'
- New hook events for these protocols - 'zmp', 'aard102' and 'mcp'
- 'Free' windows (such as the Connections window, edit and preference windows)
    were too small on some popular Linux distros and on *BSD. Axmud now
    attempts to increase the default size of these windows, if it thinks the
    default size isn't big enough. You can now set the default size yourself, if
    you need to, using the ';setwindowsize' command (or in the client preference
    window). The layout of the Connections window has been rearranged so that
    increasing the default the size is necessary on fewer systems
- Window tiling is still disabled on MS Windows. Axmud now remembers the size
    and position of each type of window, so you only need to rearrange windows
    on your desktop once. On Linux and *BSD, this functionality is turned off by
    default, but can be turned on if you want to disactive window tiling
    (using the ';disactivategrid' command). New client commands are available:
    ';togglewindowstorage', ';applywindowstorage', ';dumpwindowstorage' and
    ';clearwindowstorage'
- A new type of random exit. When an exit leads to a randomly-generated area
    every time you go through it, you can now set the exit so that Axmud
    automatically creates a temporary region. Axmud will also try to detect
    when you've arrived back at the original room and, at that point, the
    temporary region is deleted

Major fixes
- Pueblo frames were 100% non-functional in the previous release. Fixed
- Fixed crash in some Axbasic scripts that try to CALL a SUBroutine
- Problems with clicking on exits in the automapper window were fixed in the
    previous release, but apparently made the problems worse. Another fix has
    been applied
- Buttons in the automapper window's toolbar were not desensitised (greyed out)
    correctly. Fixed throughout
- World commands are normally echoed in the main window, in green. This can be
    turned off, but handling of world commands in this situation was broken. The
    problem has been fixed; in addition, echoing of world commands can now be
    enabled/disabled in the Quick Preferences window (as well as in the client
    preference window, as usual)

Minor new features
- The code handling incoming text from the world has been rewritten and
    optimised somewhat. If you're connected to a world with dozens of colour
    changes per line, you might notice a considerable performance improvement
- The Debugger task has been renamed as the System task, and can now divert all
    system messages (including ordinary yellow system messages) into its task
    window. The colour of system messages is now preserved in the task window
    (this behaviour can be turned off, if not wanted). The ';setdebuggermode'
    command has been renamed as ';setsystemmode'
- Regions can now be created with a generic name, e.g. 'unnamed_7',
    'temporary_9'. When you're prompted for a name, just leave the box empty.
    Temporary regions in the list on the left-hand side of the automapper window
    are now drawn in italics, and separately from all other regions

Minor fixes
- Fixed incorrect handling of ATCP/GMCP data in ';simulatehook'
- Fixed error in the Connections window caused when typing a replacement host
    name
- The ';axbasichelp' command now accepts keywords and function names in capital
    letters (since they appear in all-caps throughout the documentation)
- Fixed several buttons in the Object Viewer window, which were not able to
    view handle various buffer lines correctly
- When drawing 'wilderness' rooms, the first room in a region was incorrectly
    drawn with exits. Fixed
- The basic mudlist (the long list of worlds visible in the Connections window)
    now names the Russian language using Cyrillic text
- The default size for 'main' windows was not loaded from its data file. Fixed
- Fixed problems with the aliases for ';allocateexit', e.g. ';north',
    ';southwest', ';up', seen whenever the commands are typed with the wrong
    arguments
- Fixed several crashes seen when the automapper is tracking the current
    location while the automapper window isn't open
- Several other minor fixes

v1.1.138 (31 Aug 2018)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pre-configured worlds
- Ten new pre-configured worlds: Adventures Unlimited, Bylins MUD, Clessidra
    MUD, DragonStone, Eternal Darkness, HexOnyx, RavenMUD, RealmsMUD, Two Towers
    and Waterdeep
- Minor improvements to the existing pre-configured worlds: CoffeeMud,
    Discworld, EmpireMud 2.0. If you want to import the improvements into your
    existing world profiles, use ';updateworld' (for example
    ';updatworld discworld'). If you don't want to risk overwriting any changes
    you've made to those profiles, don't use ';updateworld'
- The basic mudlist (visible by clicking the planet icon in the Connections
    window) has been expanded by about 150 worlds
- This version adds a new 'wilderness' plugin, especially for users of
    EmpireMUD 2.0, that modifies its world profile to use wilderness mode (see
    below) in the most effective way and, if loaded a second time, reverts those
    changes

Major new features
- Numerous improvements and enhancements to the automapper (see section below)
- Greatly improved handling of Russian-language worlds. At most of them, the
    KOI-8 character set is now applied automatically. Cyrillic text, and not
    gibberish, should now be visible in most of Axmud's windows. Axmud's
    internal regular expressions now recognise non-Roman characters. Profiles
    and other Axmud objects (collections of data) can now be given names using
    non-English characters, so automatic login using a Cyrillic character name
    is now possible. The Locator and automapper windows have been tested using
    Russian directions (see the Bylins pre-configured world for a demonstration)
- Handling of other non-English worlds has also been improved. Axmud's
    phrasebooks, which are used to create dictionaries in various languages,
    have been updated. The correct phrasebook is now applied to any world in the
    basic mudlist, so for most non-English worlds compass directions in the
    Compass task shouldn't require any configuration
- The Connections window can now search both lists of worlds. When sorting
    alphabetically, worlds beginning with articles like 'The' and 'A' are now
    sorted correctly
- If you don't want Axmud to display certain colours, you can now modify colour
    schemes so that those colours are filtered out. You can also specify that
    only the default text and background colours should be used. This will be
    useful for those of you who wanted to read black text on a white background,
    but could not, because the world was using so many different colours. The
    'edit' window now has buttons for quickly swapping the text/background
    colours, and for matching the underlay/background colours
- New Channels task, which works much like the Divert task, but has multiple
    tabs. Both tasks use the same world profile patterns, so you can use
    whichever one you prefer (but you can't run both at the same time)
- The Divert task used to be limited to four channels ('tell', 'social',
    'custom' and 'warning'). Both the Channels and Divert task can now use any
    number of channels
- The old ';adddivertpattern', ';deletedivertpattern' and ';listdivertpattern'
    commands have been replaced with ';addchannelpattern',
    ';deletechannelpattern' and ';listchannelpattern'. The new commands work
    with both the Channels and Divert tasks. There's also a new
    ';emptychannelswindow' command
- If you create a colour scheme called 'divert', the Divert task will use that
    colour scheme rather than the default one. As a result, you can configure
    different task windows to use their own colours and fonts, if you like.
    Changes to a colour scheme are now applied to all windows using that scheme
    as soon as you click the 'save' or 'OK' button. Several related issues were
    fixed at the same time

Major fixes
- Fixed an issue in the Locator wizard which failed at worlds where the exit
    list was spread across multiple lines
- Tasks in the global initial tasklist (those that start automatically whenever
    you connect to a world) could not be configured using their 'edit' windows.
    Fixed several related issues
- Axmud is capable of converting invisible text (e.g. black text on a black
    background) to something visible, but there was no way to turn it on (or
    off) from any 'edit' or preference window. Fixed
- Fixed a couple of segfaults
- Entry boxes in many 'edit' windows only accepted an even number, when they
    should have accepted a fractional number. Fixed

Automapper new features
- Added graffiti. Temporarily mark rooms you've visited with an X; very useful
    if you want to check every room in a region. When graffiti mode is turned
    on, a count of visited and unvisited rooms appears in the automapper
    window's title bar
- Multiple toolbars. Use the red plus button to make additional toolbars
    visible. You can still switch between button sets in the first toolbar at
    the top of the window. The order of buttons on existing toolbars has been
    improved a little
- A toolbar has been added with various buttons for setting the number of
    character visits in each room. Existing operations to modify those values
    have been improved, and most of them will now work on multiple rooms at the
    same time. Those of you who want to keep track of which rooms you've visited
    and how often you've visited them should find these improvements make it
    much quicker to modify the stored values, when required
- Painting rooms in different colours, using room flags, should now be much
    quicker. There's a new toolbar which you can use to choose your favourite
    colours (room flags), and to toggle them on and off. The layout of various
    'edit' windows that use room flags have been greatly improved
- Rooms can now be automatically painted if their room title, description,
    exit list, contents or room commands match any patterns that you specify
    (ideal for worlds like EmpireMud 2.0, which have a small set of room titles
    corresponding to different terrain types)
- You can now add and delete your own room flags, if you don't like the default
    set that Axmud provides. (Only custom room flags can be deleted)
- Added new room flags for bus stops, player-controlled shops and cafes.
- There's another new toolbar which you can use to colour in the background map
    directly. It's ideal for features like rivers and mountain ranges which
    exist in the world, but can't be accessed directly by the player. The map is
    divided into an invisible grid, with one room per grid, and you can paint
    each gridblock (or a group of gridblocks) any colour you want
- The organisation of items in the window's menu has been improved in a number
    of cases. A number of new menu items have been added
- Labels can now be drawn in different sizes and colours, and even inside a
    coloured box. You can either customise each label individually, or you can
    use one of several label styles - one for titles, one for street names, one
    for bridges, and so on. Four label styles are provided; you can use those,
    or you can create your own label styles
- Label styles can be handled with the new commands ';addlabelstyle',
    ';editlabelstyle', ';renamelabelstyle', ';deletelabelstyle' and
    ';listlabelstyle'
- If your labels are spread untidily all around the whole map, you can now ask
    Axmud to align them either vertically or horizontally (or both)
- You can now select multiple rooms and labels by holding down your left mouse
    button and dragging the cursor over the map
- When multiple rooms are selected, they are now all dragged at the same time
- You can now move selected rooms/labels by pressing CTRL+C and clicking on
    a location on the map. CTRL+C can be disabled entirely if you don't want it.
    (CTRL+V is not necessary, and in fact does nothing)
- Much better handling of wilderness zones (large areas of the world in which
    the rooms have no exit lists, because movement is possible in all
    directions). In these areas it's no longer necessary for your maps to
    contain exits at all. See the Axmud Guide for a discussion of how
    wilderness rooms have been implemented
- Added crafty moves mode for worlds like Discworld, which has a lot of exits
    that don't appear in a room's exit list (but it's obvious from the minimap
    that the exits exist). When crafty moves mode is turned on, you can move in
    any direction, and if the automapper doesn't already know that an exit
    exists in that direction, it creates a hidden exit for you
- Added transient exits for worlds like Discworld, which has moving vehicles;
    when the vehicle is in a room, additional exits appear in the room's exit
    list. You can now set exits like 'board wagon' as transient exits, so the
    automapper won't try to draw them and won't get confused if you enter a room
    containing them
- For worlds that have a lot of hidden exits, the automapper can now track the
    direction in which you tried and failed to move, so you can systematically
    try every direction from every room until you've found every possible hidden
    exit. Use 'Exits > Exit options > Collect Checked directions' to turn it on.
    When turned on, the automapper draws checked directions in pink. Model
    reports can now show how many rooms have been checked in every direction
- Added a new ';insertfailedexit' command. When you try to move in a direction
    but the world refuses, you might get a standard refusal message or you might
    get a different one in every room. An unrecognised refusal message means
    you have to reset the Locator task and set the current room again; the new
    command takes care of that in a flash. If you don't like typing, you can use
    the new toolbar button instead; it's the red 'FE' button
- The automapper draws exits as an 'X' when they're in non-primary directions.
    It's up to you, the user, to decide in which direction the exit should be
    drawn. Normally it's necessary to click on each exit individually, selecting
    a primary direction one exit at a time. The new ';allocateexit' command
    makes this process much quicker. For example, in a room with 'kitchen' and
    'bathroom' exits, you could type ';allocateexit north kitchen' or
    ';allocateexit se bathroom'. You can even miss out the command word
    altogether, and just type ';north kitchen' or ';se bathroom'.
- You were already able to add notes to rooms (right-click a room on the map,
    select 'Edit room... > Notes'. Any notes you make are now displayed in the
    room's tooltip, when your mouse is hovering above the room. If you don't
    want to see them, notes in tooltips can be turned off, leaving the
    information that was already visible there
- Saved maps (world models) will now be between 10-25% smaller, depending on
    what kind of data the model is storing. Load times will improve by the same
    proportion
- The ';locateroom' command now selects all matching rooms on the map, so after
    getting lost it's easier to work out where you are. Some issues with that
    command have been fixed, so it will now work more reliably
- The automapper's 'Reposition all maps' operation now sets the visible level
    back to level 0, as well as resetting magnification and the position of
    scrollbars

Automapper fixes
- Dragging exits was often very difficult because the exit could not be clicked,
    or immediately unselected itself after being clicked. This has been fixed,
    and dragging an exit should now be as easy as clicking on it
- The automapper was not able to track movement in a non-primary direction like
    'enter cupboard' immediately after a room had been set as a current room.
    Fixed
- Fixed a crash caused, in certain circumstances, by selected rooms in the
    automapper window
- The automapper sometimes failed to draw twin exits correctly, when one or both
    were in non-primary directions. Occasionally, this caused a crash. Both
    issues are now fixed
- Some error messages caused by the automapper's room painter have been fixed
- In the automapper window's menu, 'Rooms > Locator task > View Locator room'
    crashed Axmud. The edit window itself, once opened, also crashed Axmud. Both
    have been fixed
- Some inconsistencies in the way the automapper window desensitises (greys out)
    some of its menu items and buttons have been fixed
- The room painter incorrectly replaced certain values, such as the room's
    title, in certain situations. The automapper did not finish creating a new
    room before trying to paint it. Both issues have been fixed
- It's no longer necessary to reset the Locator task after the automapper gets
    lost; you can now set the new current room right away
- Labels in maps can now contain '&' characters without generating an error
    message

Minor new features
- The layout of the 'edit' window for routes has been improved
- The Locator task can now capture information about the weather, the time of
    day (and so on), and display that information in its task window. The
    information is not stored anywhere in the model. At present, no
    pre-configured worlds use the new 'weather' component
- The Locator task used to show the room's contents in its window, main noun
    first. You can now change that behaviour (using the task's 'edit' window),
    so the the word order isn't changed. Instead, the noun is highlighted in a
    different colour
- The About window now shows this file, and the INSTALL information file
    included with Axmud's source code
- The MS Windows installer will now let you install Axmud anywhere you want.
    Some users have reported problems with this installer. In most cases,
    running the installer a second time will work. In most cases, if Axmud
    crashes shortly after it starts for the first time, it won't crash on the
    second or subsequent occasions

Minor fixes
- The Locator task displays the number of room statements (descriptions) it's
    expecting in its title bar, but this number was not updated frequently
    enough. The visible number is now updated instantly. The same number is no
    longer displayed in the automapper's title bar (as there is no longer enough
    room there)
- Fixed some issues with MXP room tags and popup menus, which prevented (for
    example) the automapper from working at DragonStone
- Improved handling of arkward exit states (extra information about an exit in
    the room's exit list), which made correct handling of exit states at
    DragonStone impossible
- Trying to connect to a world from the basic mudlist, while specifiying a
    character and password, produced error messages. Fixed
- ';importfiles' failed to import a world profile exported with an
    ';exportfiles -w' command. Fixed
- Fixed incorrect handling of text in bold white at some worlds
- Various issues with handling and checking Axmud colour tags have been fixed
- When Axmud encounters a Perl error, it displays a long error message and
    tells the user to type ';restart' when they're ready. The error message has
    been improved so impatient users don't need to read all of it
- Fixed several issues with GMCP data that caused frequent error messages, for
    example at Avatar
- Abbreviations (aka user commands) for several client commands have changed:
    ';addworld', ';setworld', ';cloneworld', ';editworld', ';deleteworld',
    ';listworld', ';restoreworld', ';updateworld', ';setstatusevent'
- The Debugger task's 'edit' window was completely broken. Fixed it

v1.1.050 (31 Jul 2018)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pre-configured worlds
- Ten new pre-configured worlds: Age of Chaos, Avalon (Germany), Carrion Fields,
    CyberASSAULT, Elysium RPG, HellMOO, Miriani, MUME, RoninMUD, Tsunami
- Improved handling of new and existing pre-configured worlds for users who have
    just installed a new version of Axmud
- Major improvements to the existing pre-configured worlds: Avalon RPG,
    Discworld and SWMud (if you've ever connected to any of these worlds, you'll
    be prompted to update them; if not, the world profiles will be automatically
    updated)
- Minor improvements to the existing pre-configured worlds: Dead Souls Dev, Dead
    Souls Local, Dead Souls Prime, DuneMUD, Medievia, MorgenGrauen. If you want
    to import the improvements into your existing world profiles, use
    ';updateworld' (for example ';updatworld empire'). If you don't want to risk
    overwriting any changes you've made to those profiles, don't use
    ';updateworld'

Major new features
- New 'quick preferences' window, containing the most useful configuration
    options, such as changing fonts, turning on sound, etc (hopefully useful for
    users who couldn't find where they were). In the main window, click the blue
    book icon to open it
- The GUI window has been renamed the object viewer window, and expanded to
    include more kinds of object and more help files. The commands to open/close
    it are now ';openobjectviewer' and ';closeobjectviewer'
- New client commands to backup the entire Axmud data directory: 'backupdata',
    ';restoredata' and, for automated backups ';autobackup'. (This does not
    affect ordinary data file load/save operations. To avoid confusion,
    ';retainbackups' has been renamed ';retainfilecopy')
- A complete list of strings used in peek/poke operations (such as with the
    client commands ';peek' and ';poke', and with several Axbasic statements
    including PEEK and POKE) is now available in the About window, in the Axmud
    Guide and by using the new ';peekhelp' command
- For worlds that use room commands (such as EmpireMUD 2.0 and Avalon Germany),
    some new client commands: ';rommcommand', ';ignoreroomcommand',
    ';noticeroomcommand' and ';listroomcommand'. If the current location has a
    list of room commands like 'chop, harvest, gather', use ';roomcommand' to
    cycle through them. For best effect, open the Compass task and assign
    ';roomcommand' to one of the keys on your keypad
- New commands, aimed at worlds with a language that's not English, allowing you
    to set the dictionary's directions from the command line (e.g. at a
    German-language MUD, to replace 'east' with 'ost'): ';modifyprimary',
    ';addsecondary', ';modifysecondary', ';deletesecondary',
    ';setautosecondary', ';listautosecondary', ';listdirection'. Also fixed
    several problems setting directions in the dictionary's edit window

Major fixes
- Fixed crash due to problems with clickable links occasionally seen at
    MXP-heavy worlds
- Axmud is supposed to be able to recover from a Perl crash, commonly seen if
    you try to use an invalid regex (pattern) in your triggers and aliases. This
    wasn't working, which caused the connection to freeze, but it's now fixed
- Fixed multiple problems with command histories (used when you press the
    up/down cursor keys to show recent commands in the main window's command
    entry box)
- Fixed various ATCP problems which caused numerous error messages at some
    worlds
- At a few non-English worlds, the automapper produced a load of errors when
    leaving a dark room (a room with no light). Fixed

Minor new features
- The Inventory task can now cope with lines of text containing multiple items
    of inventory (in addition to the usual code, which could already cope with
    commas, the word 'and', and so on). Connect to HellMOO to see it in action
- ';copyrecording' now displays an abbreviated list of world commands, as well
    as the unabbreviated list

Minor fixes
- Some task windows (such as the Status task window) didn't have their fonts
    updated when the user updated fonts generally. Fixed
- ';playsoundeffect' now plays a random sound effect, if you don't specify one
- Fixed various problems in the zonemap and winmap edit windows. Fixed issue
    that prevented user adding winzones to a cloned winmap
- In the client preferences window, Workspaces > Page 5, fixed the faulty 'Reset
    Grids' button
- Autosaves no longer take place when connected to a world in 'offline' mode
- Fixed a few terminal error messages, occasionally seen when Axmud shuts down
- When Axmud displayed explicit line numbers and/or colour/style tags in the
    main window, clickable links appeared in the wrong place. Fixed
- Could not open the edit window for some room components from the world
    profile's edit window. Fixed, and in those edit windows there's a new button
    allowing you to specify RGB colour tags
- Fixed various problems in edit windows for TTS (text-to-speech) configurations
- New ';worldcompass' command, complementing the existing ';compass' and
    ';permcompass', and also improvements to the task's edit window, which make
    it easier to modify the commands for each keypad key that apply whenever
    Axmud starts
- ';listotherworld' has been renamed as ';listbasicworld' for consistency
- Fixed faulty handling, rarely affecting the user, of the delimiters in exit
    lists (for example the commas in 'You can go north, south, west'
- In the Connections window, you can now read English translations of the
    descriptions of non-English worlds

v1.1.012 (8 Jun 2018)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Major new features
- Text-to-speech (TTS) is now enabled on MS Windows. The Windows installer
    includes the eSpeak engine, so TTS will work out-of-the-box (no screenreader
    required)
- Added support for the 'espeak-ng' engine (on both Linux and MS Windows)

Major fixes
- Fixed issues with ';connect', ';reconnect' and ';xconnect' that especially
    affected visually-impaired users
- Fixed several issues on MS Windows. The GUI window will now open, the quick
    help file can be opened for viewing, and ';searchhelp' works again
- Autosave is now turned on by default. If you've installed a previous version
    of Axmud, your previous preferences are retained, so use ';autosave on' to
    turn on autosaves
- Fixed problems with clickable links, which caused Axmud to crash instantly
    when they occur at the end of a line
- Fixed incorrect handling of UTF-8 which made Russian-language MUDs unplayable
- Fixed packaging of Perl modules that caused CPAN archive to complain
- The .deb installer on Linux now adds two items to the Start menu, just like
    the corresponding MS Windows installer

Minor fixes
- Numerous minor fixes

v1.1.0 (31 May 2018)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- This is the first public release of Axmud
